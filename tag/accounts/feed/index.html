		</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Branded Company Accounts. Branded Company Accounts allow you to provide your viewers with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company" target="_self" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">Sign up for a free trial now</a> »</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Branded Screen Sharing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts increase your viewers’ exposure to your company’s brand by keeping your branding in front of them throughout a screen share. We allow you to customize the viewer page to include your company’s logo and color scheme. Instead of seeing the logo and color scheme of the screen-sharing product you are using, your viewers will see your company’s logo and color scheme—making it more likely that they will remember your company after the presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283" alt="branded_company_appearance" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png" width="618" height="403" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Customizable Screen Sharing Experience</strong></div>
<p><strong>Default Zoom Level for Viewers</strong> &#8211; The default can be set to either the actual size of the screen being shared or zoomed out so the shared screen fits inside your  viewer’s browser window.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Scripts</strong> &#8211; A broadcast is a screen share that can be viewed from your personal URL (e.g., https://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_company</em>). We allow you to create a broadcast script to automate the steps that your broadcast follows so that your presentations can be more effective. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You can customize:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>the message shown when you&#8217;re not broadcasting</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">the message shown when viewers join during your broadcast</span></li>
<li>the action that is taken at the end of your broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are demoing a website or application, you can customize your account so that your viewers are automatically redirected to a sign-up page at the end of the broadcast—instead of having to ask your viewers to go there themselves.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Embedded Viewer For Your Website</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts also  make it easier to integrate the screen share viewer into your company’s website, so your users never have to leave your website to view your screen shares. Integration is a snap: paste our code snippet into your webpage and your viewers will be able to engage with your screen shares right from your website.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Pricing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts cost $49/month per user. See <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/pricing">list of features available on Branded Company Accounts</a>.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Launch Special</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts move us a big step towards our goal of making screen sharing a personalized and integrated experience that allows you to maintain your company&#8217;s brand and messaging throughout your interaction with your viewers. To celebrate the launch, we will be offering a free 30-day trial to anyone who <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">signs up</a> in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Happy holidays and thank you for your continued support.</p>

		</p><p>Three months ago we launched Screenleap to the public with the mission of providing the most fast, simple, and reliable screen sharing product on the planet.  Since then we’ve received feedback from hundreds of users, and found that Screenleap is most commonly used for ad hoc collaboration among a regular set of teammates and friends.  </p>
<p>As part of our commitment to simplify screen sharing, and in response to requests for features that help teammates and friends collaborate more effectively, today we’re announcing the release of Free User Accounts and Handles (i.e. https://www.screenleap.com/MyName).  A handle is a username link that can be provided to friends, or can be bookmarked for recurring meetings.  This has been one of our most commonly requested features, and it represents a leap forward towards our vision of making screen sharing more frictionless and user friendly.  </p>
<p>Stay tuned, because we&#8217;ll soon be adding friends lists to Accounts so you can share screens with friends and teammates just by clicking their names like you do with instant messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Claim Your Free Screen Sharing Handle<br />
</strong><br />
You can claim your free user handle by signing up using our Hacker News promo.  Visit this link: <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn" title="Hacker News Screenleap Promo" target="_blank">https://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn</a></p>

<p><strong>Account Login<br />
</strong><br />
The Account Login page gives you the option to &#8220;Share my screen&#8221;, which allows you to start a single-use screen sharing session. This is a good option for private screen sessions. Or to &#8220;Broadcast my screen&#8221;, which allows you to start a session visible at www.screenleap.com/MyName. This is a permanent link that your friends can bookmark, but be careful because when you&#8217;re sharing, anyone with the link can see your screen. </p>

<p><strong>Start a Screen Sharing Session<br />
</strong><br />
Click &#8220;Broadcast my screen&#8221;, then be patient and wait a few seconds until the applet permission box pops up.  Check &#8220;Allow all applets from &#8220;www.screenleap.com&#8221; with this signature, and then click &#8220;Allow&#8221;.  Note, you must have Java installed on your computer to reach this point.  Java is not installed by default on Mac Lion.  Make sure you have Java installed, otherwise, you will not be able to proceed.  </p>

<p><strong>Share Your Screen Sharing Handle<br />
</strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve started broadcasting your screen, you can direct friends and teammates to your personal screen sharing link.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05_broadcast_handle.jpg" alt="Share Your Screen Sharing Handle" title="Share Your Screen Sharing Handle" width="542" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05_broadcast_handle.jpg 542w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05_broadcast_handle-300x221.jpg 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05_broadcast_handle-406x300.jpg 406w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>End Your Session<br />
</strong><br />
Always be sure to &#8220;Stop Sharing&#8221; when you&#8217;ve completed your screen sharing session.  If your meeting ends and you continue sharing, this could lead to accidentally sharing something you intended to be private.</p>
