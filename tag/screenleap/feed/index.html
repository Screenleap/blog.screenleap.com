		</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that you can now add support for live interaction (screen sharing, video conferencing, audio conferencing, chat, and more) to your website using our new integration feature by simply adding a snippet of code to your website: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/integration_code_snippet-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2316" width="640" height="80" style="border:0;padding:0"></figure>



<p>No additional coding is required!</p>



<p>You and your users will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of Screenleap&#8217;s live-collaboration platform directly from your website without needing to use another app or online service—all you and your users need is a web browser. You can use our integration feature to streamline your sales process with your prospects, provide your customers with more effective support, collaborate more easily with external users, host your online classes directly from your website, and more. </p>



<p>C<strong>onfiguration</strong></p>



<p>Configuring your Screenleap integration is easy: after adding the Screenleap integration code to your website, you will be able to configure your integration from the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/integration/user-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integration settings</a> page. The integration settings page also allows you to customize the integration to fit your specific needs—without the need for any programming.</p>



<p><strong>Example Integration</strong></p>



<p>You can use our integration feature to enable all sorts of interactions on your website with your users and colleagues. One common interaction is to allow your customer support agents to be able to see your customers&#8217; screens so they can provide them with faster and more effective support. An example integration with your support page could look like the following for your support agents:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="724" height="669" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/integration_session_launcher.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2276" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/integration_session_launcher.png 724w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/integration_session_launcher-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>Your support agents will be able to start a support session with your customers by asking them to go to your support page on your website. Your support agents can then go to the support page, start a support session, and select the customer whose screen they want to view. If the selected customer grants permission to share his/her screen, your support agent will be able to see his/her screen immediately from your website:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="719" height="722" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/integration_presenter_ui.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2353" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/integration_presenter_ui.png 719w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/integration_presenter_ui-300x300.png 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/integration_presenter_ui-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></figure>



<p>Best of all, your customers will not need to manually click on any share links or enter any share codes to join the support session: they will be automatically connected when the support session starts.</p>



<p>Please take a look at our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/integration/use-cases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integration use cases page</a> to see more common uses cases for our integration feature, the benefits of using our integration feature for those use cases, and suggested configuration settings and demos for those use cases that you can try out.</p>



<p><strong>Let Us Know What You Think</strong></p>



<p>This release is the culmination of our 10-year journey to fulfill our original vision for Screenleap: to make  it possible for you to easily add support for live-collaboration to your website so that you can interact in real-time with your users remotely just as easily as if they were sitting right next to you.</p>



<p>We would love for to hear your feedback regarding the new integration feature, how you are using it to improve your interactions with your users and colleagues, and anything we can add to make it work better for you. Please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a>.</p>

		</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the early-access release of our new computer audio conferencing feature. Computer audio conferencing allows you to speak with the people in your meetings using your computer&#8217;s microphone and speakers. You no longer need to call a separate dial-in number in order to speak to each other, which makes it even easier and faster to start your meetings.</p>



<p><strong>Enabling Computer Audio Conferencing</strong></p>



<p>Audio conferencing is available to users on our <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.screenleap.com/pricing" target="_blank">paid subscription plans</a>. If you are a paid subscriber, you can enable computer audio conferencing by going to your <strong>Settings &amp; Preferences</strong> from the <strong>Account</strong> menu. Select <strong>Yes, use computer audio conferencing </strong>for the<strong> Audio Preferences</strong> setting and then save your change.</p>



<p><strong>Using Computer Audio Conferencing</strong></p>



<p>When you start a meeting with computer audio conferencing enabled, you will be able to speak to other people in your meeting using your computer&#8217;s microphone and speakers. Everyone will need to be on a computer with a microphone and speakers and using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) in order to user computer audio conferencing. Computer audio conferencing also works for mobile viewers using any browser on Android and the Safari browser on iOS devices.</p>



<p>The microphone and speakers default to the defaults for your computer. You can change the microphone and speakers used by moving your mouse over the <strong>Room</strong> panel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="491" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/computer_audio-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2142" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/computer_audio-1.png 640w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/computer_audio-1-300x230.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>You can mute your microphone during your meeting by clicking on the microphone icon. </p>



<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>



<p>Computer audio conferencing is currently only available when you use our our installation-free screen sharing option. Support for computer audio conferencing will soon be available in  the <strong>Screenleap for Mac</strong> and <strong>Screenleap for Windows</strong> apps. </p>



<p>Computer audio conferencing is also limited to a maximum of ten participants during the beta period.</p>



<p><strong>Share Your Feedback</strong></p>



<p>We would love to hear what you think of the new computer conferencing feature and if you have any suggestions for improvements. We take your feedback very seriously!</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce that collaborative screen sharing is now available for the <strong>Screenleap for Mac</strong> and <strong>Screenleap for Windows</strong> apps. The collaborative screen sharing feature allows you to share control of your computer with your viewers so that you can seamlessly collaborate together online.</p>
<p>You and the viewer you are collaborating with will each have your own mouse cursor to control. You will both be able to interact with your computer using your respective keyboards and mice at the same time—it&#8217;s even better than having the other person sitting next to you at your computer since you don&#8217;t have to share your keyboard and mouse!</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>To share control of your screen with one of your viewers, you will need to have at least one person viewing your screen share. Once you have people viewing your screen, click on the mouse icon on the Screenleap console, select a viewer, and then select <strong>Share mouse/keyboard control</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/share_control_with_viewer.png" alt="" width="612" height="223" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/share_control_with_viewer.png 612w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/share_control_with_viewer-300x109.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>Your viewer will now be able to control your computer from their browser—they do not need to download or install any software. You and your viewer will have your own mouse cursor to control (your viewer&#8217;s mouse cursor will be green and will include the viewer&#8217;s name). Your viewer will be able to point things out on your screen using his/her mouse, scroll through documents using his/her scroll wheel, and interact with your screen by clicking with his/her mouse and typing on his/her keyboard.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2097" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/collaborative_screen_sharing.png" alt="" width="618" height="440" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/collaborative_screen_sharing.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/collaborative_screen_sharing-300x214.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>You can switch the viewer you are collaborating with by clicking on the mouse icon and selecting a new viewer. You can disable control sharing by clicking the mouse icon again and selecting <strong>Disable control sharing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a Mac computer, you will need to grant the <strong>Accessibility</strong> permission to the <strong>Screenleap</strong> app before you will be able to share control with your viewers. To grant the permission:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your <b>System Preferences</b>.</li>
<li>Click on <b>Security &amp; Privacy</b>.</li>
<li>Click on <b>Accessibility</b>.</li>
<li>Check the box for the <b>Screenleap</b> app (you may need to click the lock icon and enter your password to allow for checking the boxes).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>The viewer sharing control of your computer will need to make sure the viewer page is the active window and the active tab. If another window is in front of the viewer window, then your viewer&#8217;s actions will not be passed to your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Collaborative screen sharing will take your online collaboration to the next level by allowing you to interact as effectively online as if you were in the same room together. It is available to all users with a paid plan. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a> if you would like a free trial to test out the feature.</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/education">Screenleap for Education</a>, a new solution designed specifically for teachers. Screenleap for Education is the easiest way for teachers to share their screens with their students and record it for later viewing. As always with Screenleap, students can view from any web-enabled device without installing any software.</p>
<p>Teachers can use Screenleap for Education to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow students to follow along from any device,</li>
<li>allow-visually impaired students to easily see their screens,</li>
<li>give students the ability to review lessons before their exams,</li>
<li>track student engagement in real-time, and</li>
<li>save hundreds of hours each year by not having to reteach lessons to students who miss a class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setup Classes</strong></p>
<p>Getting set up with Screenleap for Education is easy: teachers can create classes and add students manually using our web interface or by importing the class and student information from a CSV file. Only students added to a class will be able to view the screen share for that class.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Setup Classes" width="618" height="308" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618-300x150.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p><strong>Screen Share for a Class</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education makes it easy for teachers to share their screens with their students. They can start a screen share for a class with a single click. We support sharing from Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, iPhones/iPads, and Android devices (including SMART Boards).</p>
<p>Students will see the list of classes they have been added to when they sign in. They can view the screen share for a class and listen to the audio with a single click—there&#8217;s no need for teachers to share a new link or code with their students each time they share their screen.</p>
<p><strong>Share Recordings</strong></p>
<p>When teachers share their screen using Screenleap for Education, we can automatically record their screen shares (including audio) using our cloud recording feature and make it available to their students after the screen share ends. Because we perform the recording in the cloud, there is no need for teachers to upload any recording after they finish their screen shares: it automatically becomes available after the screen share ends. Making recordings of their classes available to their students will help teachers improve their students&#8217; learning by allowing students to review class lessons before their exams and when they miss a class.</p>
<p><strong>Track Student Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education also allows teachers to track student engagement in real-time. Once they start sharing their screen for a class, they can open up a separate page that allows them to see which of their students are engaged with their lesson.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Student Engagement Graph" width="618" height="517" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618-300x251.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>We track and show them when students are viewing their screen share so they can see when their students are watching their screen share and when they are viewing another site. This allows them to see when they are losing their students&#8217; interest or when they need to intervene with specific students who are not paying attention. Teachers can also review the student engagement graphs after their screen share ends from the recordings page.</p>
<p><strong>Sign Up for Free Pilot</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education costs $99/year per teacher. We are currently offering Screenleap for Education for free for the fall semester. This will let you try out Screenleap risk-free at your school so you can see the benefits for yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/education/signup">Sign up for the Screenleap for Education pilot</a> »</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to schedule a demo for your teachers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@screenleap.com?subject=Screenleap+for+Education+pilot">sales@screenleap.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that we now support the recording of your audio when recording your screen. To take advantage of audio recording, you will need to select Screenleap audio conferencing as the audio conferencing option in your preferences and call in to the Screenleap conference bridge number during your screen share. Everyone calling the conference line will be included in the audio recording.</p>
<p>If you call the conference line before the screen share starts, recording of audio will begin when the screen share starts. Recording of audio will end when the screen share ends or when the last person leaves the conference line, whichever happens first.</p>
<p>We hope you find the audio recording support useful for creating complete recordings of your screen shares for later playback or sharing with your viewers.</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce that support for sharing of all of your apps is now available in the <strong>Screenleap for iOS</strong> app. Now, once your screen share has started, you can navigate to any of the apps on your iPhone and share those as well.

<p><strong>Disable sharing when not using Wi-Fi</strong> &#8211; You can disable sharing when you are not on a Wi-Fi connection to ensure that you don&#8217;t accidentally use up data from your cellular plan.</p>
<p><strong>Share screen in high-DPI mode</strong> &#8211; In high-DPI mode, the screen will be shared at twice the resolution, which will allow your viewers to see your app more clearly. The trade-off when using high-DPI mode is that the frame rate will be lower and the lag time longer.</p>
<p><strong>Record video of shares</strong> &#8211; Toggle whether you want your screen shares to be recorded. Recording of screen shares is available on the Premium and Max Plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let Us Know What You Think</strong></p>
<p>We hope you find the new support for sharing your own apps useful for demoing your company&#8217;s iPhone and iPad apps to your potential customers or showing someone you are supporting how to use a feature. If you have any questions or feedback, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a>. We would love to hear from you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since our last blog post, but we have some exciting news to share with you today. Over the last year, we have been hard at work rebuilding Screenleap from the ground up to make it faster, more scalable, and more reliable. We are excited to announce today that we have released the new platform. Your Screenleap screen shares will automatically take advantage of the improvements that it provides.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important factors affecting the success of your screen shares is how quickly your viewers can see what is on your screen. You want your viewers to be able to a) see your screen instantly and without any hassle and b) see the changes to your screen update quickly on their screens. Screenleap has always enabled the former by making viewing an installation-free experience.</p>
<p>Our new screen-sharing platform improves upon the latter by further reducing the time it takes for changes on your screen to appear on your viewers’ screens. Using our new streaming technology, we allow you to get the contents of your screen to your viewers&#8217; screen faster than ever. The frustrating process of asking your viewers if they see what is on your screen is now a thing of the past with Screenleap.</p>
<p><strong>More Viewers</strong></p>
<p>The latest version of our platform also increases the maximum number of viewers that you can have on a single screen share from 150 to over 10,000. We will be offering a new plan in the future that will allow you to take advantage of the higher viewer limit. If you would like to gain early access to higher limit, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Reliable And Consistent Screen Shares</strong></p>
<p>The latest release of the Screenleap platform also makes your screen shares perform more reliably and consistently. While it’s difficult to make real-time communication completely reliable, our new platform gets us closer by replacing our usage of technologies that are problematic for some of our users (such as WebSockets) with technologies that are more robust and reliable without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>We have also re-engineered our viewer technology so that viewers on slower networks no longer negatively affect the update speed of viewers on faster networks. What this means for you is that you can expect your viewers to experience fewer issues when connecting to your screen shares and experience more consistent screen shares once they connect.</p>
<p><strong>Give It A Try</strong></p>
<p>All current Screenleap users have been automatically updated with these improvements. If you’ve never used Screenleap before, please visit <a href="http://www.screenleap.com">http://www.screenleap.com</a> and click on the “Share your screen now” button to get started.</p>
<p>If you would like to give one of our paid plans a try, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a> to get setup with a free trial.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the improvements to Screenleap that will make your screen shares more hassle-free and successful. We will be announcing several new features in the coming weeks, so please stay tuned for more updates.</p>

<p>As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the enhancements made to Screenleap in 2014 to make screen sharing even easier for you and give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2014 HIGHLIGHTS</b></p>
<p><strong>Branded Company Account</strong></p>
<p>We added the ability to customize the look-and-feel of your accounts so that you can increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand for those important sales, support, and training calls. The <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2014/01/08/branded-company-accounts/">Branded Company Account</a> also includes support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your site to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Web Chat</strong></p>
<p>You can now quickly communicate with your viewers during your screen shares without having to jump on a call with our integrated <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2014/03/08/screenleap-chat-make-your-screen-shares-more-interactive/">web chat</a> feature.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Support</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2014/04/30/announcing-screenleap-for-support-easily-view-your-users-screens/">Screenleap for Support</a> allows you to easily see someone else&#8217;s screen so that you can provide them with better support. All you need to do is send a link to the person whose screen you want to view. The person will be guided through a quick install and then you will be able to see the person&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Scheduler</strong></p>
<p>You can now <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2014/06/02/schedule-your-screen-shares-in-advance-with-meetings/">schedule screen shares</a> in advance using the meetings feature. Meeting participants will receive an email that includes a link to the meeting and information for connecting to the audio conferencing bridge.</p>
<p><strong>HD Audio Conferencing</strong></p>
<p>We have upgraded our audio conferencing service so that you can enjoy crystal-clear conference calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>COMING UP IN 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong></p>
<p>We have a beta version of a new web technology called WebRTC available on our browser extension for you to try out. WebRTC allows us to reduce the latency so that changes to your screen show up on your viewers&#8217; screens faster. We will be rolling out the technology to all our presenter apps later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong></p>
<p>We will be launching support for recording your screen shares to both our subscribers and to our API developers at the end of the month. The recording feature will allow you to record your screen shares for later playback.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Audio</strong></p>
<p>We will be adding support for sharing audio directly from your computer so your viewers won&#8217;t need to dial-in to hear your presentation.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone/iPad/Android Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We will be adding support for sharing from your iPhones, iPads, and Android devices later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Features</strong></p>
<p>We will be making Screenleap more interactive this year. To start, we will be adding support for viewing your viewers&#8217;s mouse so that your viewers will be able to point things out to you during the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WISHING YOU A HAPPY 2015</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2014 a great one. We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2015!</p>

		</p><p>As you head back to work or school, we want to share with you some recent changes that will make your screen sharing experience even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved audio conferencing call quality</li>
<li>New default presenter app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HD Audio Conferencing</strong></p>
<p>Our audio conferencing feature has gotten even better: It now features improved audio quality for crystal-clear conference calls. With this change, we are also bringing our audio conferencing feature out of beta so it is only available on our paid plans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/faq#audio-conferencing-support">Learn more about our audio conferencing support »</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1461" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png" alt="hd_audio_conferencing" width="618" height="259" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing-300x125.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>New Default Presenter App</strong></p>
<p>After a long period of testing, we are excited to announce that we are switching the default presenter app on Windows computers from the applet to our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> app. As we discussed previously, the benefits of our new Screenleap for Windows app is that you no longer have to install Java (or keep it updated) in order to share your screen.</p>
<p>You will need to perform a quick, one-time install the first time you need to share your screen. Your viewers will continue to be able to view from any device without installing any software.</p>
<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong></p>
<p>We are putting the finishing touches on our WebRTC-based implementation of our browser share extension. Users on Chrome or Firefox will soon be able to experience a significant improvement in performance by taking advantage of WebRTC&#8217;s browser-to-browser connections. Unlike other WebRTC-based screen sharing solutions, Screenleap&#8217;s solution will also work on browsers that don&#8217;t support WebRTC (albeit with slightly slower performance).</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued support!</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce the general availability of the viewer cam feature for customers using the <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> app. The viewer cam is a small screen that appears below the control panel when a viewer starts viewing your screen.</p>
<p>It allows your presentations to run more smoothly by giving you a real-time view of what your viewers are seeing: you no longer have to ask your viewers if they are seeing what you are seeing before continuing with a presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen_share_viewer_cam.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen_share_viewer_cam.jpg" alt="screen_share_viewer_cam" width="618" height="512" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen_share_viewer_cam.jpg 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen_share_viewer_cam-300x248.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a>If you change the slide on your screen and you see the new slide in the viewer cam, then you can be confident that your viewers are also seeing the same slide.</p>
<p>The viewer cam feature is available to customers on a <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/pricing">paid plan</a>. You can enable the viewer cam feature from your <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/account/settings">Settings &amp; Preferences</a>. You can hide the viewer cam during your screen share by clicking on it.</p>
<p>The viewer cam feature is currently only available for the Screenleap for Mac app, but it will be added to the Screenleap for Windows app in the near future.</p>
