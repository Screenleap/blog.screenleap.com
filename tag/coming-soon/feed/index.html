<p>We are excited to announce that you can now share a full-screen video of yourself to your viewers using your webcam to introduce yourself and connect with your viewers during your meetings. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="559" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video_conferencing.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2250" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video_conferencing.png 640w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video_conferencing-300x262.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>To enable full-screen video conferencing, click the <strong>Video</strong> button after starting your meeting. </p>



<p>Your viewers will see a full-screen view of what your webcam is sharing. Full-screen video conferencing differs from the previously-available embedded video feature in that your viewers will see a full-screen video of your webcam, whereas the embedded video feature shows your webcam embedded in your shared screen. To switch back to sharing your screen, click the <strong>Screen</strong> button.</p>



<p>If you do not want to allow video conferencing for your meetings, you can disable it from your user preferences.</p>



<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong></p>



<p>We hope you find the full-screen video conferencing features useful for your meetings. Please stay tuned for an announcement on how you can easily start branded meetings directly from your website without going to the Screenleap website! Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">support@screenleap.com</a> if you would like early access to this feature.</p>

		</p><p>As you head back to work or school, we want to share with you some recent changes that will make your screen sharing experience even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved audio conferencing call quality</li>
<li>New default presenter app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HD Audio Conferencing</strong></p>
<p>Our audio conferencing feature has gotten even better: It now features improved audio quality for crystal-clear conference calls. With this change, we are also bringing our audio conferencing feature out of beta so it is only available on our paid plans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/faq#audio-conferencing-support">Learn more about our audio conferencing support »</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1461" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png" alt="hd_audio_conferencing" width="618" height="259" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hd_audio_conferencing-300x125.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>New Default Presenter App</strong></p>
<p>After a long period of testing, we are excited to announce that we are switching the default presenter app on Windows computers from the applet to our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> app. As we discussed previously, the benefits of our new Screenleap for Windows app is that you no longer have to install Java (or keep it updated) in order to share your screen.</p>
<p>You will need to perform a quick, one-time install the first time you need to share your screen. Your viewers will continue to be able to view from any device without installing any software.</p>
<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong></p>
<p>We are putting the finishing touches on our WebRTC-based implementation of our browser share extension. Users on Chrome or Firefox will soon be able to experience a significant improvement in performance by taking advantage of WebRTC&#8217;s browser-to-browser connections. Unlike other WebRTC-based screen sharing solutions, Screenleap&#8217;s solution will also work on browsers that don&#8217;t support WebRTC (albeit with slightly slower performance).</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued support!</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Branded Company Accounts. Branded Company Accounts allow you to provide your viewers with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company" target="_self" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">Sign up for a free trial now</a> »</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Branded Screen Sharing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts increase your viewers’ exposure to your company’s brand by keeping your branding in front of them throughout a screen share. We allow you to customize the viewer page to include your company’s logo and color scheme. Instead of seeing the logo and color scheme of the screen-sharing product you are using, your viewers will see your company’s logo and color scheme—making it more likely that they will remember your company after the presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283" alt="branded_company_appearance" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png" width="618" height="403" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2-300x195.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Customizable Screen Sharing Experience</strong></div>
<p><strong>Default Zoom Level for Viewers</strong> &#8211; The default can be set to either the actual size of the screen being shared or zoomed out so the shared screen fits inside your  viewer’s browser window.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Scripts</strong> &#8211; A broadcast is a screen share that can be viewed from your personal URL (e.g., http://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_company</em>). We allow you to create a broadcast script to automate the steps that your broadcast follows so that your presentations can be more effective. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You can customize:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>the message shown when you&#8217;re not broadcasting</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">the message shown when viewers join during your broadcast</span></li>
<li>the action that is taken at the end of your broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are demoing a website or application, you can customize your account so that your viewers are automatically redirected to a sign-up page at the end of the broadcast—instead of having to ask your viewers to go there themselves.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Embedded Viewer For Your Website</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts also  make it easier to integrate the screen share viewer into your company’s website, so your users never have to leave your website to view your screen shares. Integration is a snap: paste our code snippet into your webpage and your viewers will be able to engage with your screen shares right from your website.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Pricing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts cost $49/month per user. See <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/pricing">list of features available on Branded Company Accounts</a>.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Launch Special</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts move us a big step towards our goal of making screen sharing a personalized and integrated experience that allows you to maintain your company&#8217;s brand and messaging throughout your interaction with your viewers. To celebrate the launch, we will be offering a free 30-day trial to anyone who <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">signs up</a> in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Happy holidays and thank you for your continued support.</p>

		</p><p>It&#8217;s been an exciting summer here at Screenleap: we recently launched our Screenleap Apps for Mac and Windows, which will make it even easier for you to share your screen since they do not require Java to be installed. We will be announcing several new improvements in the coming months that will make it even easier for you to share your screen so stay tuned.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px;">
<p><strong>New Limitations For Anonymous Screen Shares</strong></p>
<p>In the mean time, we want to make you aware of some upcoming changes to the anonymous screen share feature. An anonymous screen share is a screen share that you start by clicking the &#8220;Share your screen now!&#8221; button on our site. They are designed to make it easy for you to try out Screenleap and to start a screen share quickly when you are in a hurry. To bring anonymous screen shares in line with their intended usage, we will be limiting them to twenty minutes per day and two viewers starting September 7th.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 48px;">
<p><strong>Benefits of Creating An Account</strong></p>
<p>We want to encourage you to create an account since it allows us to provide you with the best user experience. Signed-in users will continue to be able to share for two hours a day with an unlimited number of viewers.</p>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="limitations" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/limitations1.png" width="627" height="329" /></p>
<p>In addition to longer screen shares and high viewer limits, signed-in users will also get access to these additional features:</p>
<p><strong>Personal URL</strong>: When you create a Screenleap account, you choose a handle which your viewers can use to view your screen (e.g. http://www.screenleap.com/<em>YourName</em>). No more cryptic codes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Presenter Swap</strong>: Your viewers will see a “Become presenter” button. Use this option when you need to see something that’s on your viewer’s screen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="presenterswap" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/presenterswap.png" width="514" height="78" /></p>
<p><strong>Customized Broadcast Page</strong>: Customize a message for your viewers. See last month&#8217;s <a title="Customize Broadcast Page" href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/08/customize-your-broadcast-page-message/">blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Avatar</strong>: Open Account &gt; Settings and Preferences to choose an image to use as your personal avatar. Viewers will see this avatar with your broadcast messages.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="avatar" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/avatar1.png" width="458" height="329" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong><br />
Chat is coming to Screenleap in September. When you sign in to a free account you will be able to activate a chat box for sharing simple messages with your viewers. Check back soon for more information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-1116 aligncenter" alt="chat" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chat.png" width="610" height="295" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chat.png 847w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chat-300x145.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
