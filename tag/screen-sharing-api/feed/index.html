		</p><p>At Screenleap, we pride ourselves on making it free and easy to share your screen in seconds. No installation is required to view, so your viewers are literally a single click away from seeing your screen. And with the release of our <a title="Screenleap for Gmail Plugin – Share your screen instantly from within Gmail" href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/16/screenleap-for-gmail-plugin-share-your-screen-instantly-from-within-gmail/" target="_blank">Gmail extension</a> this summer, you can start a screen share without leaving your inbox.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing the Screen Sharing API</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that you can now add screen sharing to your own applications using our new screen-sharing-as-a-service <a title="Screenleap API" href="http://www.screenleap.com/api">API</a>. True to our mission of making screen-sharing easy and affordable for everyone, the API is competitively priced. We offer all developers 5 free hours of screen sharing each month, and charge just 1¢/min after that &#8212; that&#8217;s less than $1 per hour, no matter how many viewers you have.</p>
<p>Getting up and running with Screenleap is a breeze. The <a title="API Documentation" href="http://www.screenleap.com/api/overview">API Overview</a> will walk you through the process of creating your own account and adding screen sharing to your site. You can have a basic implementation running in a matter of minutes. Screenleap&#8217;s API can be white-labeled and we will be releasing additional customization options soon.</p>
<p><strong>Check out some cool usage of the Screenleap API from our pilot:</strong></p>

Procore provides seamless collaboration among large, diverse teams, from office managers to architects to on-site construction managers, and everyone in between. The Screenleap API facilitates even <span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: 'Cantarell'; font-size: 18px; color: #188218;"><strong>faster collaboration</strong></span> by effectively integrating screen sharing into Procore&#8217;s cloud-based construction software application. Procore takes pride in listening to its clients: they asked for faster collaboration and that is exactly what the Screenleap API integration achieves.</span></p>
