										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that the next generation of the Screenleap Platform is now available for the API. Over the last year, the Screenleap Platform has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to make it faster, more scalable, and more reliable. Please see our <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2017/03/02/announcing-new-release-of-screenleap-with-faster-and-more-reliable-screen-sharing/">previous blog article</a> for more information about the benefits of the new platform.</p>
<p>You can switch your screen shares to use the new platform by adding the &#8220;useV2=true&#8221; parameter to your request to create a screen share:</p>
<p>POST <strong>https://api.screenleap.com/v2/screen-shares?accountid=[account_id]&amp;useV2=true</strong></p>
<p>All API screen shares will default to the new platform starting on September 1st, but we recommend that you update your code to take advantage of the benefits now.</p>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@screenleap.com</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<p>As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the enhancements made to Screenleap in 2014 to make screen sharing even easier for you and give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2014 HIGHLIGHTS</b></p>
<p><strong>Branded Company Account</strong></p>
<p>We added the ability to customize the look-and-feel of your accounts so that you can increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand for those important sales, support, and training calls. The <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2014/01/08/branded-company-accounts/">Branded Company Account</a> also includes support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your site to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Web Chat</strong></p>
<p>You can now quickly communicate with your viewers during your screen shares without having to jump on a call with our integrated <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2014/03/08/screenleap-chat-make-your-screen-shares-more-interactive/">web chat</a> feature.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Support</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2014/04/30/announcing-screenleap-for-support-easily-view-your-users-screens/">Screenleap for Support</a> allows you to easily see someone else&#8217;s screen so that you can provide them with better support. All you need to do is send a link to the person whose screen you want to view. The person will be guided through a quick install and then you will be able to see the person&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Scheduler</strong></p>
<p>You can now <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2014/06/02/schedule-your-screen-shares-in-advance-with-meetings/">schedule screen shares</a> in advance using the meetings feature. Meeting participants will receive an email that includes a link to the meeting and information for connecting to the audio conferencing bridge.</p>
<p><strong>HD Audio Conferencing</strong></p>
<p>We have upgraded our audio conferencing service so that you can enjoy crystal-clear conference calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>COMING UP IN 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong></p>
<p>We have a beta version of a new web technology called WebRTC available on our browser extension for you to try out. WebRTC allows us to reduce the latency so that changes to your screen show up on your viewers&#8217; screens faster. We will be rolling out the technology to all our presenter apps later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong></p>
<p>We will be launching support for recording your screen shares to both our subscribers and to our API developers at the end of the month. The recording feature will allow you to record your screen shares for later playback.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Audio</strong></p>
<p>We will be adding support for sharing audio directly from your computer so your viewers won&#8217;t need to dial-in to hear your presentation.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone/iPad/Android Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We will be adding support for sharing from your iPhones, iPads, and Android devices later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Features</strong></p>
<p>We will be making Screenleap more interactive this year. To start, we will be adding support for viewing your viewers&#8217;s mouse so that your viewers will be able to point things out to you during the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WISHING YOU A HAPPY 2015</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2014 a great one. We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2015!</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Happy New Year Screenleapers!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the improvements made to Screenleap this year and</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2014.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2013 Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
We launched <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/01/22/screenleap-launches-integrated-audio-conference-calling/">integrated audio conferencing</a> last January so that you can have a conversation with your viewers without having to use a separate conferencing service. Audio conferencing is available for free on all Screenleap accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong><br />
In February, we launched <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/overview">Screenshots</a>, a browser extension that allows you to easily take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others.</p>
<p><strong>Browser Sharing</strong><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The browser extension we launched in February also includes support for <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">browser </a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">sharing</a>. Browser sharing</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is like screen sharing except only the contents of your browser are shared. It&#8217;s especially convenient since it doesn&#8217;t require you to have Java installed, and it works on Chromebook computers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Page Customization</strong><br />
In July, we added the ability to <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/08/customize-your-broadcast-page-message/">customize your broadcast page message</a>. When you create a Screenleap account, you select a personal handle. Now you can customize the message viewers see when they visit your handle page (e.g., https://screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>) when you are not broadcasting your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Restriction and Locking</strong><br />
By default, broadcasts are public and viewable by anyone who visits your handle page. If you would like to share your screen to your handle page but want to restrict who can view your broadcast, you can do so as of the launch of <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/15/secure-your-broadcasts-with-broadcast-restriction-and-broadcast-locking/">broadcast restriction and locking</a> in late July.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Mac &amp; Screenleap for Windows</strong><br />
Having made viewing installation-free and hassle-free, we next turned our attention to towards simplifying the screen share process. We launched our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> apps in August, which allow you to share your entire screen without having to first install Java on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap API, Version 2</strong><br />
We released <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/api/update">version 2 of the Screenleap API</a> in September. The Screenleap API makes it easy to programatically add screen sharing to your web app. Version 2 includes support for additional sharing options, customization options, and integration options. You now have the option of allowing your presenters to share their screen using the Mac and Windows apps in addition to the applet.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Coming in 2014</strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Branded Company Accoount</strong><br />
We will be launching our Branded Company Accounts next week. Branded Company Accounts will allow you to increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand by providing them with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls. Branded Company Accounts will also include support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your website to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Solution</strong><br />
Our upcoming <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/customer-support-software">customer support solution</a> will allow you to easily see your customers&#8217; screens so you can provide them with faster and more effective support.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong><br />
We will be taking advantage of a new web technology called WebRTC that allows us to double the performance of screen shares for browsers that support the new technology.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing You a Happy 2014</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2013 a great one.  We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2014!</p>

		</p><p>When we launched the Screenleap API a year ago, it was in response to your requests asking for a way to integrate our quick &amp; easy screen sharing service with your applications. Since then, hundreds of you have used our API to add screen sharing to your audio conferencing solutions, e-learning platforms, webinar products, and much more.</p>
<p>To celebrate the one year anniversary of our API, we are excited to announce the launch of version 2, which offers additional sharing, customization, and integration options. We highlight the major changes below. Please see our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/api/update">API Updates</a> page for a complete list of all changes.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Sharing Options</strong></div>
<p>Sharing your screen was enabled through our Java applet in version 1 of our API. With version 2, we introduce two additional sharing options: 1) native apps for Macs and Windows and 2) a browser extension.</p>
<p>The native apps allow your users to share their screen by downloading and running a small app. They have the benefit of allowing your users to share their entire screen without having  to install Java on their computers.</p>
<p>The browser extension allows your users to share the contents of their browser windows. Although limited to sharing browser content, the browser extension does not require Java to be installed nor does it require any software download.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Customization Options</strong></div>
<p>Version 2 introduces additional options for customizing your screen shares to match your requirements. You can now hide many of the controls that are shown in the presenter control panel, such as the pause button, stop button, and the toggle for switching between partial and full screen modes. We also now allow you to customize the title that is shown on the control panel so you can use your own branding.</p>
<p>For the viewer page, you can now specify whether you want to default the viewer page to the actual size of the screen being shared or to shrink the screen so it fits in the users&#8217; browser window.</p>
<p>Finally, it is now possible to localize the sharing control panel and the viewer page to your own language. Please <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/support">contact us</a> for details on how to do so.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Integration Options</strong></div>
<p>Version 2 of our API allows you to achieve tighter integration with our screen sharing service through the use of JavaScript callbacks. The callbacks allow your application to be notified of events such as when a screen share starts, when a screen share ends, when a viewer connects, and when a viewer disconnects. You can use this information to do things like show or hide additional information about a viewer as they enter or leave the screen share.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>API Demo</strong></div>
<p>We have revamped our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/api/demo">API Demo</a> page to include all the options available in our API. You can start screen shares and play around with the various sharing and customization options from the demo page.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screenleap_api_v2_demo.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1247" alt="screenleap_api_v2_demo" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screenleap_api_v2_demo.png" width="618" height="447" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screenleap_api_v2_demo.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screenleap_api_v2_demo-300x216.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Build Something Great</strong></div>
<p>We are excited to see what you build with the new API. If you have any questions about any of the new options or having some questions about how to integrate with the API, please <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/support">contact us</a> for assistance. We would also love to profile how you are using the Screenleap API on our site so please <a href="https://screenleap.wufoo.com/forms/api-customer-success-stories/" target="_blank">share your story with us</a>!</p>

		</p><p>We love to hear all the amazing ways that companies and organizations are making use of the Screenleap API. We highlight TechChange today in the first of our API Success Story series.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-910 alignright" style="border: 0;" alt="techchange" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/techchange.png" width="385" height="118" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/techchange.png 385w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/techchange-300x91.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /><a href="https://www.techchange.org/">TechChange</a> is a Washington, DC-based organization that provides technology training to humanitarian aid and international development workers. Their interactive e-learning platform has been used by more than 600 students from more than 70 countries. Through their courses, students have learned how to use technology to foster collaboration, transform conflicts, fight diseases, monitor elections, distribute food, and more. Their story has been featured in <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/06/technology-and-development">The Economist</a>.</p>
<p>We got the opportunity to catch up with TechChange&#8217;s CTO, William Chester, to discuss the company and how they are using Screenleap to extend the real-time capabilities of their online learning platform.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a little about yourself and your role at TechChange?</b></p>
<p>As CTO of TechChange, I am responsible for development of the online learning platform. I took a somewhat circuitous route to this position. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by computers and technology: I had the good fortune of having an older brother who would take apart all the electronics we had at home. I&#8217;d need to put it back together again in order to use it and I learned a lot about how things worked in the process. After studying International Relations and Chinese as an undergrad, I spent two years working at a foundation in China. I then moved back to DC and joined the TechChange team, where I draw on both my background in technology and my experience in international development.</p>
<p><b>Why did TechChange decide to build its own e-learning platform?</b></p>
<p>We researched the existing online learning platforms, but didn&#8217;t find any that met our needs. We saw an opportunity to create an online learning platform that was more engaging, social, and interactive, so we decided to build it. Our current platform puts a strong emphasis on live engagement with subject matter experts, practitioners, and other course participants.</p>
<p><b>How did you learn about Screenleap?</b></p>
<p>We initially used an alternative solution for screen sharing but found their Flash-based technology and lack of deep integration and customization a major frustration for our experts and participants. We began an exhaustive search for an alternative and found Screenleap. We were immediately drawn to Screenleap&#8217;s API integration and HTML5 technology stack.</p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to integrate with the Screenleap API?</b></p>
<p>Our former screen sharing solution required no less than six steps for a presenter to launch a screen share. This was often cumbersome, confusing, and frustrating. Even when it did work, it relied on Flash, which we found to be buggy, resource intensive, and generally unreliable. We use Screenleap&#8217;s API to implement a one-step solution that integrates seamlessly with our existing architecture. Using the powerful API, we have much greater control of our screen shares. The fact that Screenleap is built on HTML5 technologies and does not rely on Flash has greatly increased the flexibility and reliability of our system.</p>
<p>In addition, Screenleap&#8217;s support has been outstanding from the very beginning. We&#8217;ve always received prompt, detailed, and informative responses to all of our inquiries. For all of these reasons we are thrilled to be using the Screenleap API in our platform.</p>
<p><b>What are you doing with your Screenleap integration? What problems are you solving with the API?</b></p>
<p>Incorporating global guest expert presentations into our courses is integral to our learning model. Because we draw on participants and experts from all over the world, we need a flexible solution that allows presenters to engage with our diverse user base in real-time. In a typical course we will invite 5-15 speakers to present to our participants about specific topics we&#8217;re covering in a course. Participants can follow along and ask questions via text chat or audio/video.</p>
<p>The power of Screenleap is allowing technology experts to seamlessly demo their projects, tools, and platforms for a global audience. We also set up virtual office hours where course participants can drop by and view interactive demos from TechChange staff about how to use the latest tech tools for development. The ability to demonstrate these tools and approaches using Screenleap has been an invaluable addition to our platform and the learning outcomes of our participants.</p>

		</p><p>We launched our all-in-one browser extension last month that allows you to take screenshots and to screen share your browser window from one tool. This month, we would like to delve deeper into the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/overview">screenshots</a> feature. </p>
<p>Screenshots is the easiest way to take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others. Even though we are big fans of screen sharing, we realize that it might not always be the best way to share the contents of your screen. For interactions where immediate feedback is not necessary, you can now use Screenshots to easily take screenshots and share them with others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenlea_screenshots_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Take And Share Screenshots With Fewer Steps</strong></p>
<p>At Screenleap, we love to remove unnecessary steps from processes. Having tackled screen sharing, we also wanted to streamline the process of taking and sharing screenshots. Despite being something that people do frequently, taking and sharing screenshots today still requires far too many steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a screenshot using a utility found on your computer.</li>
<li>Save the screenshot to your hard drive.</li>
<li>Find the screenshot on your computer.</li>
<li>Open the screenshot in a image-editing tool.</li>
<li>Mark up the screenshot.</li>
<li>Save the screenshot back to your hard drive.</li>
<li>Attach the screenshot to an email.</li>
<li>Send the email to the other person.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of steps—especially if you have to do it more than once. Using Screenshots, you can do the above in fewer steps using a single tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a screenshot.</li>
<li>Mark it up using the built-in editor.</li>
<li>Share it via email, Facebook, Twitter, or to your Screenleap public/group feed.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenleap_screenshots_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-686" title="Mark Up Screenshot" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenleap_screenshots_2.jpg" alt="Markl Up Screenshot" width="618" height="400" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenleap_screenshots_2.jpg 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenleap_screenshots_2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenleap_screenshots_2-463x300.jpg 463w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Share Publicly Or With A Group</strong></p>
<p>A feature of Screenshots that distinguishes it from other screen capture tools is our support for public and group sharing. When you take screenshots, they are automatically saved to your personal feed, which only you can access.</p>
<p>You can publish the screenshots that you want to share to a public feed that anyone can access or to a group feed that only people you invite can access. You can use group feeds to share information with your team, perform group research, get design feedback, and to report bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Install Screenshots</strong></p>
<p>Screenshots is available as a browser extension on Chrome and Firefox. We will be releasing a Safari version as soon as a Safari bug is fixed by Apple. You can install the extension by going to the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/install">Screenshots installation page</a>. Once installed, you will be able to quickly take and share screenshots of web pages without leaving your browser. There&#8217;s no need to remember keyboard shortcuts or launch a separate screen capture app.</p>
<p>We would love to hear how you are making use of Screenshots and how we can make it work better for you so please <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/feedback">share them with us</a>!</p>
<p>Happy Screenleaping!<br />
The Screenleap Team</p>

		</p><p>At Screenleap, we pride ourselves on making it free and easy to share your screen in seconds. No installation is required to view, so your viewers are literally a single click away from seeing your screen. And with the release of our <a title="Screenleap for Gmail Plugin – Share your screen instantly from within Gmail" href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/16/screenleap-for-gmail-plugin-share-your-screen-instantly-from-within-gmail/" target="_blank">Gmail extension</a> this summer, you can start a screen share without leaving your inbox.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing the Screen Sharing API</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that you can now add screen sharing to your own applications using our new screen-sharing-as-a-service <a title="Screenleap API" href="https://www.screenleap.com/api">API</a>. True to our mission of making screen-sharing easy and affordable for everyone, the API is competitively priced. We offer all developers 5 free hours of screen sharing each month, and charge just 1¢/min after that &#8212; that&#8217;s less than $1 per hour, no matter how many viewers you have.</p>
<p>Getting up and running with Screenleap is a breeze. The <a title="API Documentation" href="https://www.screenleap.com/api/overview">API Overview</a> will walk you through the process of creating your own account and adding screen sharing to your site. You can have a basic implementation running in a matter of minutes. Screenleap&#8217;s API can be white-labeled and we will be releasing additional customization options soon.</p>
<p><strong>Check out some cool usage of the Screenleap API from our pilot:</strong></p>
