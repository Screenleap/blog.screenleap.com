		</p><p>We are excited to announce that subscribers on our Premium Account can now record their screen shares for later playback.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Recording</strong></p>
<p>To enable recording, simply sign into your Premium account, click on the &#8220;Recordings&#8221; link, and then click on the &#8220;Enable recording&#8221; button.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1824" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page.png" alt="recordings_page" width="618" height="254" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page-300x123.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>All of your screen shares will now be recorded. Recording will start when your screen share starts.</p>
<p><strong>Recording Processing</strong></p>
<p>When your screen share ends, your recording will be encoded as a MP4 video that you can view or download. It takes some time to process your recording to encode it into a MP4 video. On average, the processing time will be comparable to the duration of the screen share: an hour-long screen share will take about an hour to process.</p>
<p>You can be notified via email when your recording is ready for you to view or download by enabling email notifications from the &#8220;Recordings&#8221; page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1840" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page_enable_notifications.png" alt="recordings_page_enable_notifications" width="618" height="335" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page_enable_notifications.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/recordings_page_enable_notifications-300x163.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>You can view or download your processed recordings from the &#8220;Recordings&#8221; page. To view your recorded screen share, simply click on the &#8220;View&#8221; link for the screen share you would like to see. You can download the recording by right-clicking on the &#8220;View&#8221; link and selecting the &#8220;Save video as&#8230;&#8221; option. Your Premium account includes 50GB of storage space for storing your recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Recordings are limited to three hours in duration. The recording feature currently does not support recording of audio. We plan to support audio recording once we add integrated audio support.</p>
<p><strong>Give Recording A Try</strong></p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy the new recording feature! As a reminder, it’s only available for Premium subscriptions, so be sure to upgrade to get access to recording, as well as custom branding, SSL encryption, unlimited daily sharing, meeting scheduling, and more. If you would like a free trial of the Premium account, please <a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">contact us</a> to get set up.</p>

</a>Happy New Year Screenleapers!</p>
<p>Thank you for making last year such an amazing one. We started Screenleap in October of 2011 with a mission: make it as easy to share your screen with someone online as it is for the person to walk over to your computer. With your feedback and support, we made a lot of progress towards that goal last year. Below is a quick recap of the features we launched in 2012 and what you can expect from Screenleap in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>January</strong><br />
We <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/01/27/introducing-screenleap/">launched a screen sharing tool</a> that allows your viewers to view your screen from any device with a web browser—without installing any additional software.</p>
<p><strong>April</strong><br />
We added the ability to share your screen with your viewers by directing them to a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/04/27/claim-your-free-screen-sharing-user-handle/">personalized user handle</a> (i.e., http://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>). If you don&#8217;t have one already, please sign up to claim your free user handle and see how fast and easy it is to share your screen this way.</p>
<p><strong>June</strong><br />
We made it even easier to share your screen with the people you collaborate with the most frequently using the <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/09/collaborate-more-quickly-with-screen-sharing-friends-list/">Friends List</a>.</p>
<p><strong>July</strong><br />
We launched a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/16/screenleap-for-gmail-plugin-share-your-screen-instantly-from-within-gmail/">Gmail browser extension</a> that allows you to share your screen instantly from within Gmail.</p>
<p><strong>September</strong><br />
We launched a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/09/19/add-screen-sharing-to-your-site-with-the-screenleap-api/">screen share API</a> that allows developers to easily add screen sharing to their own applications.</p>
<p><strong>December</strong><br />
We launched <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/12/03/faster-and-more-secure-screen-sharing-with-pro-accounts/">Pro Accounts</a> that provide dedicated servers for faster screen sharing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2013, we have a number of features in the works that we will be announcing very soon on this blog. Some of the features that you can look forward to in 2013 include:</p>
<p><strong>Screen Capture Tool (a.k.a. Screenshots)</strong><br />
We know that screen sharing is not always the best way to show someone the contents of your screen and to get feedback. Later this month, we will be launching a screen capture tool called Screenshots that will allow you to easily take screenshots, mark them up, share them with people, and allow them to give you feedback on their own time.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
This is one of the most frequently requested features by our users. We will launch a test version of it this month for you to use.</p>
<p><strong>In-Browser Sharing</strong><br />
Our installation-free viewer makes it super-easy for people to view your shared screen—all they need to do is click on a link you send them or type in a share code at the Screenleap website. But we want to make it even easier for people to start sharing their screen. We will be launching a browser plugin soon that will allow you to share your browser window without having to install any additional third-party software—just click a button on your browser to start sharing your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Product</strong><br />
The In-Browser Sharing tool will be extremely useful for web-based customer support. Users can share their screens with customer support representatives in seconds with just a couple of clicks without having to leave the page that they are on. We are currently launching our pilot for this feature. Please contact us at <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/support">support</a> if you would like to participate.</p>
<p>Thanks again for making 2012 such a wonderful year for Screenleap. Wishing you lots of success, health, and happiness in 2013!</p>
<p>The Screenleap Team</p>

		</p><p>Happy Holidays Screenleapers!</p>
<p>Although it has been available for a few weeks now, we are excited to <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/screenleap_screen_share_pro_accounts.png"><br />
</a>formally announce the launch of Pro Accounts for Screenleap. For just $10/month, you can now enjoy all the benefits of our no-hassle screen sharing solution along with SSL security and better screen share performance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-564" style="border: 0;" title="screenleap_screen_share_pro_accounts" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/screenleap_screen_share_pro_accounts.png" alt="Screenleap screen share Pro Accounts" width="300" height="218" /></p>
<p>Pro Accounts feature end-to-end SSL encryption of all of screen shares. This means that your screen shares are protected from unauthorized access during transmission from your computer to your viewers. SSL is the same encryption technology that banks use to secure your data and is recommended for users who are sharing sensitive information.</p>
<p>In addition to SSL security, we have also set up faster and more powerful servers that are reserved exclusively for Pro Account users. Because of the popularity of our free screen sharing service, the performance of individual screen shares can sometimes slow during periods of high demand (such as during the mid-morning period). With dedicated servers, Pro Account users can be sure of having faster and more reliable screen shares for those important sales demos and product pitches. It is recommended that all business users take advantage of Pro Accounts to ensure the best performance for their screen shares.</p>
<p>You can get started now by <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup?accountType=PRO">signing up for a Pro Account</a>.</p>
