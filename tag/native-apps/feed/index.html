<p>We are excited to share with you the next evolution of the Screenleap service. Our goal has always been to support installation-free sharing and viewing on all devices. Our latest release moves us closer to that vision and all the convenience and benefits that it brings to you.</p>



<p>With the latest release, you will now be able to take advantage of the benefits of installation-free sharing on all the major desktop browsers while still being able to use features that were exclusive to our Screenleap for Mac and Screenleap for Windows apps—namely the ability to share a portion of your screen using rectangle mode and the ability to share controls of your screen with your viewers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="436" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenleap_installation_free_sharing_with_add_on.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2195" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenleap_installation_free_sharing_with_add_on.png 640w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenleap_installation_free_sharing_with_add_on-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>Our installation-free sharing with add-on support has many advantages over the native apps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>You can start sharing from any desktop computer without having to install any app. All you need is a web browser.</li><li>We are able to provide your viewers with a sharper and clearer screen than possible with the native apps.</li><li>Installation-free sharing uses less CPU than the native apps so your computer will run cooler, use less power (great for laptops), and allows you to use more apps simultaneously when sharing your screen.</li><li>Installation-free sharing is more reliable than our native apps. Your meetings are less likely to end unexpectedly as a result.</li><li>You do not need to worry about keeping your app up-to-date. As a result, your meetings are less likely to be delayed by an app update.</li></ol>



<p>Installation-free sharing is now available on all desktop computers with a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari). The add-on, which provides support for rectangle mode and control sharing, is currently available for Mac and Windows computers.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the added convenience and benefits provided by installation-free sharing with add-on support—especially when you are collaborating with external users, such as your prospects and business partners. Stay tuned for upcoming enhancements that will allow you to collaborate with your users without leaving your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 15px; width:240px; height: auto;">
		<img src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png" width="240" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
		</p><p>We are excited to announce the launch of Screenleap for Mac and Screenleap for Windows—two new apps that now allow you to share your screen without having to first install Java on your computer. You can give the new app a try by clicking the button below:</p>
<p><button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='https://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap app</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Background</strong></div>
<p>Our mission at Screenleap is to make screen sharing a hassle-free experience. We first made viewing hassle-free by removing the need for viewers to download or install any software. We next turned our attention towards improving the sharing experience: with the release of Screenleap for Mac and Screenleap for Windows, you can now share your screen without having to first install Java.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b>Screenleap for Mac</b></div>
<p>Using Screenleap for Mac app requires a one-time download and installation. Once installed, the Screenleap icon will be added to your menu bar and your screen share will automatically start.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" alt="Screenleap for Mac Installation" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png" width="618" height="200" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install-300x97.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>When you end your screen share session, your computer screen will no longer be shared but the Mac app will continue to run. The next time you need to share your screen, you screen share will start instantly (you will not have to download or install the app again). You can start a new screen share by either a) visiting our website and clicking on the <b>Share your screen now!</b> button or b) clicking on the Screenleap icon in the menu bar and then clicking on the <b>Start Screen Share</b> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" alt="Share Your Screen Using Screenleap for Mac" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png" width="618" height="150" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share-300x72.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>Give it a try: <button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='https://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap for Mac</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b>Screenleap for Windows</b></div>
<p>Screenleap for Windows needs to be downloaded and runned each time you share your screen, but the entire process only takes a few seconds since it is a very small download. We will be releasing an enhancement in the next few weeks that will make it so that you only need to download the app the first time you use it.</p>
<p>In addition to all the features of the Java-based app, the Windows app comes with a bonus feature: the Windows app allows you to select a specific window to share (such as an Excel window).</p>
<p>Give it a try: <button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='https://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap for Windows</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong></div>
<p>We will be releasing some enhancements in the next few weeks that will make sharing using the apps even more hassle-free. Our goal is to make one-click sharing and viewing a reality for everyone. With this release, we get one step closer. Please stay tuned for more!</p>
