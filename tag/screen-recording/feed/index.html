										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that we now support the recording of your audio when recording your screen. To take advantage of audio recording, you will need to select Screenleap audio conferencing as the audio conferencing option in your preferences and call in to the Screenleap conference bridge number during your screen share. Everyone calling the conference line will be included in the audio recording.</p>
<p>If you call the conference line before the screen share starts, recording of audio will begin when the screen share starts. Recording of audio will end when the screen share ends or when the last person leaves the conference line, whichever happens first.</p>
<p>We hope you find the audio recording support useful for creating complete recordings of your screen shares for later playback or sharing with your viewers.</p>
