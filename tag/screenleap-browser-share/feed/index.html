		</p><p class="p1">We are excited to announce that the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">Screenleap Chrome extension</a> now supports presenter swap. Previously, only users using the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> or <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> apps could switch the presenter during a screen share. Now users on Chromebook, Linux, and any operating system that supports the Chrome browser can also take advantage of this useful feature during their screen shares.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Using Presenter Swap</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">To enable the presenter swap feature, you simply need to sign in before starting your screen share. The viewer who wants to become the new presenter needs to initiate a presenter swap by clicking the &#8220;Become presenter&#8221; button at the top-right part of the viewer page.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1883" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_button.png" alt="" width="618" height="434" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_button.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_button-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p class="p1">You will be asked if you want to grant the viewer permission to be the new presenter.</p>
<p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1884" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_grant_permission.png" alt="" width="618" height="262" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_grant_permission.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/presenter_swap_grant_permission-300x127.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p class="p1">If you say yes, the viewer will start sharing his/her screen and you will be redirected to the viewer page so that you will be able to see his/her screen. Viewers who have not previously shared using Screenleap will be first prompted to download and install the presenter app.</p>
<p class="p1">Presenter swap cannot be initiated by the presenter because we do not require viewers to sign in before being able to see your screen. As a result, it is not possible for the presenter to select which viewer he/she wants to be the new presenter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tell Us About Your Experience</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We hope you find the presenter swap feature useful. You can try out the Screenleap Chrome extension by going to the <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">installation page</a>. If you have any questions or feedback, please don&#8217;t hesitate to <span class="s3"><a href="mailto:support@screenleap.com">contact us</a>!</span></span></p>
