<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Happy New Year Screenleapers!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the improvements made to Screenleap this year and</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2014.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2013 Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
We launched <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/01/22/screenleap-launches-integrated-audio-conference-calling/">integrated audio conferencing</a> last January so that you can have a conversation with your viewers without having to use a separate conferencing service. Audio conferencing is available for free on all Screenleap accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong><br />
In February, we launched <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/overview">Screenshots</a>, a browser extension that allows you to easily take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others.</p>
<p><strong>Browser Sharing</strong><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The browser extension we launched in February also includes support for <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">browser </a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">sharing</a>. Browser sharing</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is like screen sharing except only the contents of your browser are shared. It&#8217;s especially convenient since it doesn&#8217;t require you to have Java installed, and it works on Chromebook computers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Page Customization</strong><br />
In July, we added the ability to <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/08/customize-your-broadcast-page-message/">customize your broadcast page message</a>. When you create a Screenleap account, you select a personal handle. Now you can customize the message viewers see when they visit your handle page (e.g., http://screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>) when you are not broadcasting your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Restriction and Locking</strong><br />
By default, broadcasts are public and viewable by anyone who visits your handle page. If you would like to share your screen to your handle page but want to restrict who can view your broadcast, you can do so as of the launch of <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/15/secure-your-broadcasts-with-broadcast-restriction-and-broadcast-locking/">broadcast restriction and locking</a> in late July.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Mac &amp; Screenleap for Windows</strong><br />
Having made viewing installation-free and hassle-free, we next turned our attention to towards simplifying the screen share process. We launched our <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> apps in August, which allow you to share your entire screen without having to first install Java on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap API, Version 2</strong><br />
We released <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/api/update">version 2 of the Screenleap API</a> in September. The Screenleap API makes it easy to programatically add screen sharing to your web app. Version 2 includes support for additional sharing options, customization options, and integration options. You now have the option of allowing your presenters to share their screen using the Mac and Windows apps in addition to the applet.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Coming in 2014</strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Branded Company Accoount</strong><br />
We will be launching our Branded Company Accounts next week. Branded Company Accounts will allow you to increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand by providing them with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls. Branded Company Accounts will also include support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your website to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Solution</strong><br />
Our upcoming <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/customer-support-software">customer support solution</a> will allow you to easily see your customers&#8217; screens so you can provide them with faster and more effective support.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong><br />
We will be taking advantage of a new web technology called WebRTC that allows us to double the performance of screen shares for browsers that support the new technology.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing You a Happy 2014</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2013 a great one.  We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2014!</p>

</a>Happy New Year Screenleapers!</p>
<p>Thank you for making last year such an amazing one. We started Screenleap in October of 2011 with a mission: make it as easy to share your screen with someone online as it is for the person to walk over to your computer. With your feedback and support, we made a lot of progress towards that goal last year. Below is a quick recap of the features we launched in 2012 and what you can expect from Screenleap in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>January</strong><br />
We <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/01/27/introducing-screenleap/">launched a screen sharing tool</a> that allows your viewers to view your screen from any device with a web browser—without installing any additional software.</p>
<p><strong>April</strong><br />
We added the ability to share your screen with your viewers by directing them to a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/04/27/claim-your-free-screen-sharing-user-handle/">personalized user handle</a> (i.e., http://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>). If you don&#8217;t have one already, please sign up to claim your free user handle and see how fast and easy it is to share your screen this way.</p>
<p><strong>June</strong><br />
We made it even easier to share your screen with the people you collaborate with the most frequently using the <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/09/collaborate-more-quickly-with-screen-sharing-friends-list/">Friends List</a>.</p>
<p><strong>July</strong><br />
We launched a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/07/16/screenleap-for-gmail-plugin-share-your-screen-instantly-from-within-gmail/">Gmail browser extension</a> that allows you to share your screen instantly from within Gmail.</p>
<p><strong>September</strong><br />
We launched a <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/09/19/add-screen-sharing-to-your-site-with-the-screenleap-api/">screen share API</a> that allows developers to easily add screen sharing to their own applications.</p>
<p><strong>December</strong><br />
We launched <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2012/12/03/faster-and-more-secure-screen-sharing-with-pro-accounts/">Pro Accounts</a> that provide dedicated servers for faster screen sharing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2013, we have a number of features in the works that we will be announcing very soon on this blog. Some of the features that you can look forward to in 2013 include:</p>
<p><strong>Screen Capture Tool (a.k.a. Screenshots)</strong><br />
We know that screen sharing is not always the best way to show someone the contents of your screen and to get feedback. Later this month, we will be launching a screen capture tool called Screenshots that will allow you to easily take screenshots, mark them up, share them with people, and allow them to give you feedback on their own time.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
This is one of the most frequently requested features by our users. We will launch a test version of it this month for you to use.</p>
<p><strong>In-Browser Sharing</strong><br />
Our installation-free viewer makes it super-easy for people to view your shared screen—all they need to do is click on a link you send them or type in a share code at the Screenleap website. But we want to make it even easier for people to start sharing their screen. We will be launching a browser plugin soon that will allow you to share your browser window without having to install any additional third-party software—just click a button on your browser to start sharing your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Product</strong><br />
The In-Browser Sharing tool will be extremely useful for web-based customer support. Users can share their screens with customer support representatives in seconds with just a couple of clicks without having to leave the page that they are on. We are currently launching our pilot for this feature. Please contact us at <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/support">support</a> if you would like to participate.</p>
<p>Thanks again for making 2012 such a wonderful year for Screenleap. Wishing you lots of success, health, and happiness in 2013!</p>
<p>The Screenleap Team</p>
