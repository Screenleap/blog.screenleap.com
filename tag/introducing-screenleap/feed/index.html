		</p><p>We are excited to announce the launch of Screenleap for Mac and Screenleap for Windows—two new apps that now allow you to share your screen without having to first install Java on your computer. You can give the new app a try by clicking the button below:</p>
<p><button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='http://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap app</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Background</strong></div>
<p>Our mission at Screenleap is to make screen sharing a hassle-free experience. We first made viewing hassle-free by removing the need for viewers to download or install any software. We next turned our attention towards improving the sharing experience: with the release of Screenleap for Mac and Screenleap for Windows, you can now share your screen without having to first install Java.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b>Screenleap for Mac</b></div>
<p>Using Screenleap for Mac app requires a one-time download and installation. Once installed, the Screenleap icon will be added to your menu bar and your screen share will automatically start.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" alt="Screenleap for Mac Installation" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png" width="618" height="200" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_install-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>When you end your screen share session, your computer screen will no longer be shared but the Mac app will continue to run. The next time you need to share your screen, you screen share will start instantly (you will not have to download or install the app again). You can start a new screen share by either a) visiting our website and clicking on the <b>Share your screen now!</b> button or b) clicking on the Screenleap icon in the menu bar and then clicking on the <b>Start Screen Share</b> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" alt="Share Your Screen Using Screenleap for Mac" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png" width="618" height="150" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop_screen_share_mac_native_share-300x72.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>Give it a try: <button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='http://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap for Mac</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b>Screenleap for Windows</b></div>
<p>Screenleap for Windows needs to be downloaded and runned each time you share your screen, but the entire process only takes a few seconds since it is a very small download. We will be releasing an enhancement in the next few weeks that will make it so that you only need to download the app the first time you use it.</p>
<p>In addition to all the features of the Java-based app, the Windows app comes with a bonus feature: the Windows app allows you to select a specific window to share (such as an Excel window).</p>
<p>Give it a try: <button class="native-screen-share-button primary-green" onclick="window.location.href='http://www.screenleap.com/share?shareUsingNative=true';">Share your screen using <b>Screenleap for Windows</b></button></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong></div>
<p>We will be releasing some enhancements in the next few weeks that will make sharing using the apps even more hassle-free. Our goal is to make one-click sharing and viewing a reality for everyone. With this release, we get one step closer. Please stay tuned for more!</p>

		</p><p>Sharing what’s on your computer screen with people across the web is a magical experience that truly enables you to communicate, collaborate, share, and connect.</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 557px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.screenleap.com"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="size-full wp-image-108" title="Introducing Screenleap" alt="Introducing Screenleap" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/screenleap_03d.jpg" width="547" height="335" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-caption-text">Introducing Screenleap</p></div>
<p>Prior to founding <a href="http://www.screenleap.com">Screenleap</a>, our team members made frequent use of screen sharing services such as WebEx and GoToMeeting. Unfortunately, these tools fall short of day-to-day needs by burdening the experience with unnecessary hurdles, ultimately causing people to avoid them altogether. Screen sharing shouldn’t be that way. It should be fast, simple, and free. This is the problem Screenleap seeks to solve.</p>
<p>After talking with hundreds of users about their experiences using existing screen sharing tools, we found a common list of complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its too cumbersome to start a meeting – most of the time its just not worth it</li>
<li>It takes me five to ten minutes to start a meeting with a new viewer because they have to download and install a new application</li>
<li>My viewers can’t view it if they’re on a smartphone or tablet device</li>
<li>My viewers refuse to install the application or I don&#8217;t want to burden them with a required install</li>
<li>Its too complicated – I can’t figure it out</li>
<li>The service is expensive, or I don’t want to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>We share these frustrations and resolved to launch a product that completely eliminates, or drastically mitigates, each of the above complaints. The result is found at Screenleap.com and is the product of countless hours of research, hacking, coding, and user input.</p>
<p>The Screenleap mission is to make screen sharing as simple, fast, free, and easy as possible.</p>
<p>So today we officially launch Screenleap to the public with the following alpha features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-click instant screen sharing for first time users</li>
<li>One-click instant screen sharing for visitors who have previously granted permission to our applet</li>
<li>No accounts required</li>
<li>No application install to view a screen</li>
<li>Works on any connected mobile or tablet device with a browser</li>
<li>The basic version is Free, and always will be</li>
</ul>
