		</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Branded Company Accounts. Branded Company Accounts allow you to provide your viewers with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company" target="_self" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">Sign up for a free trial now</a> »</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Branded Screen Sharing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts increase your viewers’ exposure to your company’s brand by keeping your branding in front of them throughout a screen share. We allow you to customize the viewer page to include your company’s logo and color scheme. Instead of seeing the logo and color scheme of the screen-sharing product you are using, your viewers will see your company’s logo and color scheme—making it more likely that they will remember your company after the presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283" alt="branded_company_appearance" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png" width="618" height="403" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Customizable Screen Sharing Experience</strong></div>
<p><strong>Default Zoom Level for Viewers</strong> &#8211; The default can be set to either the actual size of the screen being shared or zoomed out so the shared screen fits inside your  viewer’s browser window.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Scripts</strong> &#8211; A broadcast is a screen share that can be viewed from your personal URL (e.g., https://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_company</em>). We allow you to create a broadcast script to automate the steps that your broadcast follows so that your presentations can be more effective. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You can customize:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>the message shown when you&#8217;re not broadcasting</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">the message shown when viewers join during your broadcast</span></li>
<li>the action that is taken at the end of your broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are demoing a website or application, you can customize your account so that your viewers are automatically redirected to a sign-up page at the end of the broadcast—instead of having to ask your viewers to go there themselves.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Embedded Viewer For Your Website</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts also  make it easier to integrate the screen share viewer into your company’s website, so your users never have to leave your website to view your screen shares. Integration is a snap: paste our code snippet into your webpage and your viewers will be able to engage with your screen shares right from your website.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Pricing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts cost $49/month per user. See <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/pricing">list of features available on Branded Company Accounts</a>.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Launch Special</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts move us a big step towards our goal of making screen sharing a personalized and integrated experience that allows you to maintain your company&#8217;s brand and messaging throughout your interaction with your viewers. To celebrate the launch, we will be offering a free 30-day trial to anyone who <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">signs up</a> in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Happy holidays and thank you for your continued support.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Happy New Year Screenleapers!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the improvements made to Screenleap this year and</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2014.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2013 Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
We launched <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/01/22/screenleap-launches-integrated-audio-conference-calling/">integrated audio conferencing</a> last January so that you can have a conversation with your viewers without having to use a separate conferencing service. Audio conferencing is available for free on all Screenleap accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong><br />
In February, we launched <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/overview">Screenshots</a>, a browser extension that allows you to easily take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others.</p>
<p><strong>Browser Sharing</strong><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The browser extension we launched in February also includes support for <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">browser </a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">sharing</a>. Browser sharing</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is like screen sharing except only the contents of your browser are shared. It&#8217;s especially convenient since it doesn&#8217;t require you to have Java installed, and it works on Chromebook computers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Page Customization</strong><br />
In July, we added the ability to <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/08/customize-your-broadcast-page-message/">customize your broadcast page message</a>. When you create a Screenleap account, you select a personal handle. Now you can customize the message viewers see when they visit your handle page (e.g., https://screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>) when you are not broadcasting your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Restriction and Locking</strong><br />
By default, broadcasts are public and viewable by anyone who visits your handle page. If you would like to share your screen to your handle page but want to restrict who can view your broadcast, you can do so as of the launch of <a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/15/secure-your-broadcasts-with-broadcast-restriction-and-broadcast-locking/">broadcast restriction and locking</a> in late July.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Mac &amp; Screenleap for Windows</strong><br />
Having made viewing installation-free and hassle-free, we next turned our attention to towards simplifying the screen share process. We launched our <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> apps in August, which allow you to share your entire screen without having to first install Java on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap API, Version 2</strong><br />
We released <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/api/update">version 2 of the Screenleap API</a> in September. The Screenleap API makes it easy to programatically add screen sharing to your web app. Version 2 includes support for additional sharing options, customization options, and integration options. You now have the option of allowing your presenters to share their screen using the Mac and Windows apps in addition to the applet.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Coming in 2014</strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Branded Company Accoount</strong><br />
We will be launching our Branded Company Accounts next week. Branded Company Accounts will allow you to increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand by providing them with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls. Branded Company Accounts will also include support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your website to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Solution</strong><br />
Our upcoming <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/customer-support-software">customer support solution</a> will allow you to easily see your customers&#8217; screens so you can provide them with faster and more effective support.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong><br />
We will be taking advantage of a new web technology called WebRTC that allows us to double the performance of screen shares for browsers that support the new technology.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing You a Happy 2014</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2013 a great one.  We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2014!</p>
