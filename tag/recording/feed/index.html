		</p><p>Happy Leap Day everyone! In celebration of Leap Day, we are excited to announce that Screenleap will be taking the next leap forward with features that will make it even easier for you to share your screen and collaborate with anyone, anywhere. We want to give you a preview of some of the changes that you will be seeing to the service this coming week.</p>
<p><strong>Installation-Free Screen Sharing</strong></p>
<p>With the upcoming release, Screenleap will be returning to our roots with the return of installation-free screen sharing. When Screenleap was originally founded, we offered installation-free sharing through our Java-based presenter app. Unfortunately, as Macs and Windows moved away from Java due to security issues, we had to abandon the Java-based app in favor of our native apps, which required installation before you could share your screen.</p>
<p>We are excited that we will again be able to offer installation-free screen sharing for desktop users using Chrome and the latest Edge browsers (Firefox coming soon). Coupled with our installation-free viewing feature that we offer on all platforms, sharing your screen with the people you collaborate with has never been easier or faster.</p>
<p><strong>Simpler and More Streamlined User Interface</strong></p>
<p>We have been working hard to simplify the Screenleap service to make it even easier for you to use. We have made two changes that should make sharing your screen even easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>We removed the need for your to decide whether you should a private screen share or a broadcast. If you want to share your screen now, you can now simply click the <strong>Meet now</strong> button. For paid users, you can decide if you want to lock your meetings by default. If your meetings are unlocked, your viewers can join your meeting to view your screen by going to your personal link (https://screenleap.com/[handle].  If your meeting is locked, your viewers can join your meeting by going to the 9-digit screen share code for your meeting (i.e., https://screenleap.com/[screen share code] or by going to your personal link and entering the 9-digit screen share code. You can also specify your own access code if you prefer.</li>
<li>Everyone can now schedule meetings (free accounts are limited to 2 upcoming meetings at a time). Previously, free users could only start on-demand screen shares, which is problematic if you have back-to-back meetings and you are sharing to your personal URL <em>(https://screenleap.com/[your handle])</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Unified Presenter Interface</strong></p>
<p>We have moved all the controls that you will use during your meetings into a unified web interface that all the presenter apps will use. No matter what operating system you are using, you will soon be able to control your meeting using the same familiar interface.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2115" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/screenleap_presenter_ui.png" alt="" width="640" height="483" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/screenleap_presenter_ui.png 640w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/screenleap_presenter_ui-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The new presenter interface includes a preview of your shared screen so you can check ahead of time that your screen share is working correctly.</p>
<p>We have also made it easy to change your meeting settings during your meeting, instead of requiring you to configure everything in advance:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can now start recording your meeting after your meeting has already started. Previously, you had to enable recording before starting your meeting.</li>
<li>You can now start and stop recording your screen multiple times during your meeting. Previously, you could only start recording when your meeting started and stop recording when your meeting ended.</li>
<li>You can now change the quality of your screen share during your meetings. For example, you may want to increase the quality if you are sharing a complex spreadsheet (high quality image but lower frame rate) or lower the quality when sharing a video (for better frame rate).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong></p>
<p>There are many more exciting features that will be included in the upcoming release, but we wanted to share some of them with you now so you can hopefully get as excited as we are. Wishing everyone a Happy Leap Day again!</p>

		</p><p>We are excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/education">Screenleap for Education</a>, a new solution designed specifically for teachers. Screenleap for Education is the easiest way for teachers to share their screens with their students and record it for later viewing. As always with Screenleap, students can view from any web-enabled device without installing any software.</p>
<p>Teachers can use Screenleap for Education to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow students to follow along from any device,</li>
<li>allow-visually impaired students to easily see their screens,</li>
<li>give students the ability to review lessons before their exams,</li>
<li>track student engagement in real-time, and</li>
<li>save hundreds of hours each year by not having to reteach lessons to students who miss a class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setup Classes</strong></p>
<p>Getting set up with Screenleap for Education is easy: teachers can create classes and add students manually using our web interface or by importing the class and student information from a CSV file. Only students added to a class will be able to view the screen share for that class.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Setup Classes" width="618" height="308" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618-300x150.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p><strong>Screen Share for a Class</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education makes it easy for teachers to share their screens with their students. They can start a screen share for a class with a single click. We support sharing from Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, iPhones/iPads, and Android devices (including SMART Boards).</p>
<p>Students will see the list of classes they have been added to when they sign in. They can view the screen share for a class and listen to the audio with a single click—there&#8217;s no need for teachers to share a new link or code with their students each time they share their screen.</p>
<p><strong>Share Recordings</strong></p>
<p>When teachers share their screen using Screenleap for Education, we can automatically record their screen shares (including audio) using our cloud recording feature and make it available to their students after the screen share ends. Because we perform the recording in the cloud, there is no need for teachers to upload any recording after they finish their screen shares: it automatically becomes available after the screen share ends. Making recordings of their classes available to their students will help teachers improve their students&#8217; learning by allowing students to review class lessons before their exams and when they miss a class.</p>
<p><strong>Track Student Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education also allows teachers to track student engagement in real-time. Once they start sharing their screen for a class, they can open up a separate page that allows them to see which of their students are engaged with their lesson.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Student Engagement Graph" width="618" height="517" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618-300x251.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>We track and show them when students are viewing their screen share so they can see when their students are watching their screen share and when they are viewing another site. This allows them to see when they are losing their students&#8217; interest or when they need to intervene with specific students who are not paying attention. Teachers can also review the student engagement graphs after their screen share ends from the recordings page.</p>
<p><strong>Sign Up for Free Pilot</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education costs $99/year per teacher. We are currently offering Screenleap for Education for free for the fall semester. This will let you try out Screenleap risk-free at your school so you can see the benefits for yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/education/signup">Sign up for the Screenleap for Education pilot</a> »</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to schedule a demo for your teachers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@screenleap.com?subject=Screenleap+for+Education+pilot">sales@screenleap.com</a>.</p>
