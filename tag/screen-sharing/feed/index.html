		</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Branded Company Accounts. Branded Company Accounts allow you to provide your viewers with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company" target="_self" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">Sign up for a free trial now</a> »</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Branded Screen Sharing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts increase your viewers’ exposure to your company’s brand by keeping your branding in front of them throughout a screen share. We allow you to customize the viewer page to include your company’s logo and color scheme. Instead of seeing the logo and color scheme of the screen-sharing product you are using, your viewers will see your company’s logo and color scheme—making it more likely that they will remember your company after the presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283" alt="branded_company_appearance" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png" width="618" height="403" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/branded_company_appearance2-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Customizable Screen Sharing Experience</strong></div>
<p><strong>Default Zoom Level for Viewers</strong> &#8211; The default can be set to either the actual size of the screen being shared or zoomed out so the shared screen fits inside your  viewer’s browser window.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Scripts</strong> &#8211; A broadcast is a screen share that can be viewed from your personal URL (e.g., http://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_company</em>). We allow you to create a broadcast script to automate the steps that your broadcast follows so that your presentations can be more effective. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You can customize:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>the message shown when you&#8217;re not broadcasting</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">the message shown when viewers join during your broadcast</span></li>
<li>the action that is taken at the end of your broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are demoing a website or application, you can customize your account so that your viewers are automatically redirected to a sign-up page at the end of the broadcast—instead of having to ask your viewers to go there themselves.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Embedded Viewer For Your Website</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts also  make it easier to integrate the screen share viewer into your company’s website, so your users never have to leave your website to view your screen shares. Integration is a snap: paste our code snippet into your webpage and your viewers will be able to engage with your screen shares right from your website.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Pricing</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts cost $49/month per user. See <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/pricing">list of features available on Branded Company Accounts</a>.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Launch Special</strong></div>
<p>Branded Company Accounts move us a big step towards our goal of making screen sharing a personalized and integrated experience that allows you to maintain your company&#8217;s brand and messaging throughout your interaction with your viewers. To celebrate the launch, we will be offering a free 30-day trial to anyone who <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup/company">signs up</a> in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Happy holidays and thank you for your continued support.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year Screenleapers! As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the improvements made to Screenleap this year and give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2014. 2013 Highlights Audio Conferencing We launched integrated audio conferencing last January so that you can have a conversation with your viewers [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Happy New Year Screenleapers!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As we bid goodbye to another great year, we would like to highlight the improvements made to Screenleap this year and</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> give you a preview of what&#8217;s in the works for 2014.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2013 Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio Conferencing</strong><br />
We launched <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/01/22/screenleap-launches-integrated-audio-conference-calling/">integrated audio conferencing</a> last January so that you can have a conversation with your viewers without having to use a separate conferencing service. Audio conferencing is available for free on all Screenleap accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong><br />
In February, we launched <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/screenshots/overview">Screenshots</a>, a browser extension that allows you to easily take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others.</p>
<p><strong>Browser Sharing</strong><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The browser extension we launched in February also includes support for <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">browser </a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/browser-share">sharing</a>. Browser sharing</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is like screen sharing except only the contents of your browser are shared. It&#8217;s especially convenient since it doesn&#8217;t require you to have Java installed, and it works on Chromebook computers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Page Customization</strong><br />
In July, we added the ability to <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/08/customize-your-broadcast-page-message/">customize your broadcast page message</a>. When you create a Screenleap account, you select a personal handle. Now you can customize the message viewers see when they visit your handle page (e.g., http://screenleap.com/<em>your_handle</em>) when you are not broadcasting your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Restriction and Locking</strong><br />
By default, broadcasts are public and viewable by anyone who visits your handle page. If you would like to share your screen to your handle page but want to restrict who can view your broadcast, you can do so as of the launch of <a href="http://blog.screenleap.com/2013/07/15/secure-your-broadcasts-with-broadcast-restriction-and-broadcast-locking/">broadcast restriction and locking</a> in late July.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap for Mac &amp; Screenleap for Windows</strong><br />
Having made viewing installation-free and hassle-free, we next turned our attention to towards simplifying the screen share process. We launched our <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#mac">Screenleap for Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/desktop-screen-share#win">Screenleap for Windows</a> apps in August, which allow you to share your entire screen without having to first install Java on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Screenleap API, Version 2</strong><br />
We released <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/api/update">version 2 of the Screenleap API</a> in September. The Screenleap API makes it easy to programatically add screen sharing to your web app. Version 2 includes support for additional sharing options, customization options, and integration options. You now have the option of allowing your presenters to share their screen using the Mac and Windows apps in addition to the applet.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Coming in 2014</strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Branded Company Accoount</strong><br />
We will be launching our Branded Company Accounts next week. Branded Company Accounts will allow you to increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand by providing them with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls. Branded Company Accounts will also include support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your website to view your screen shares.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support Solution</strong><br />
Our upcoming <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/customer-support-software">customer support solution</a> will allow you to easily see your customers&#8217; screens so you can provide them with faster and more effective support.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares</strong><br />
We will be taking advantage of a new web technology called WebRTC that allows us to double the performance of screen shares for browsers that support the new technology.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing You a Happy 2014</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2013 a great one.  We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you. Wishing you lots of health, happiness, and success in 2014!</p>

		</p><p>Screenleap is commonly used as a collaboration tool for tight-knit groups of teammates when working remotely or even intra-office.  As part of our mission to provide the fastest, simplest and most reliable screen sharing product on the planet, today we&#8217;re announcing the general availability of Friends Lists.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screen_sharing_friends_list_01.jpg" alt="Screenleap Friends List" title="Screenleap Friends List" width="203" height="319" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screen_sharing_friends_list_01.jpg 203w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screen_sharing_friends_list_01-190x300.jpg 190w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></p>
<p>Friends Lists are free, and allow teammates to share their screens in under 10 seconds.  A <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/login" title="Screenleap Account">Screenleap account</a> (free) is required, and account holders, when logged in, are immediately alerted with online notifications when a friend would like to share their screen &#8211; kind of like instant messaging.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screen_share_invitation_01.jpg" alt="Screen Sharing with Teammates" title="Screen Sharing with Teammates" width="283" height="107" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-276" /></p>
<p>Account holders not currently logged in are dispatched an email or text message with link to the screen sharing session based on their contact permission settings (email or text).  </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/friend_email_invitation_01.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/friend_email_invitation_01.jpg" alt="Screen Sharing Email Invitation" title="Screen Sharing Email Invitation" width="435" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/friend_email_invitation_01.jpg 435w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/friend_email_invitation_01-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, instead of having to read share codes out loud, or copy/paste email links, teammates can be invited to see your screen with the click of a button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screen_share.jpg" alt="Screen Share with Friends" title="Screen Share with Friends" width="283" height="95" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274" /></p>
<p>Sharing screens with your teammates has never been easier.  You can get started today by <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/login" title="Screenleap Account">signing up for an account</a>, adding your friends and co-workers to your Friends List, and then starting screen sharing sessions faster than anywhere else on the web!</p>

		</p><p>Three months ago we launched Screenleap to the public with the mission of providing the most fast, simple, and reliable screen sharing product on the planet.  Since then we’ve received feedback from hundreds of users, and found that Screenleap is most commonly used for ad hoc collaboration among a regular set of teammates and friends.  </p>
<p>As part of our commitment to simplify screen sharing, and in response to requests for features that help teammates and friends collaborate more effectively, today we’re announcing the release of Free User Accounts and Handles (i.e. http://www.screenleap.com/MyName).  A handle is a username link that can be provided to friends, or can be bookmarked for recurring meetings.  This has been one of our most commonly requested features, and it represents a leap forward towards our vision of making screen sharing more frictionless and user friendly.  </p>
<p>Stay tuned, because we&#8217;ll soon be adding friends lists to Accounts so you can share screens with friends and teammates just by clicking their names like you do with instant messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Claim Your Free Screen Sharing Handle<br />
</strong><br />
You can claim your free user handle by signing up using our Hacker News promo.  Visit this link: <a href="http://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn" title="Hacker News Screenleap Promo" target="_blank">http://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/01_new_account2.jpg" alt="New Screen Sharing Account with Handle" title="New Screen Sharing Account With Handle" width="542" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/01_new_account2.jpg 542w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/01_new_account2-300x221.jpg 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/01_new_account2-406x300.jpg 406w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Account Login<br />
</strong><br />
The Account Login page gives you the option to &#8220;Share my screen&#8221;, which allows you to start a single-use screen sharing session. This is a good option for private screen sessions. Or to &#8220;Broadcast my screen&#8221;, which allows you to start a session visible at www.screenleap.com/MyName. This is a permanent link that your friends can bookmark, but be careful because when you&#8217;re sharing, anyone with the link can see your screen. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/02_broadcast_screen.jpg" alt="Screenleap Login Screen" title="Screenleap Login Screen" width="542" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/02_broadcast_screen.jpg 542w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/02_broadcast_screen-300x221.jpg 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/02_broadcast_screen-406x300.jpg 406w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Start a Screen Sharing Session<br />
</strong><br />
Click &#8220;Broadcast my screen&#8221;, then be patient and wait a few seconds until the applet permission box pops up.  Check &#8220;Allow all applets from &#8220;www.screenleap.com&#8221; with this signature, and then click &#8220;Allow&#8221;.  Note, you must have Java installed on your computer to reach this point.  Java is not installed by default on Mac Lion.  Make sure you have Java installed, otherwise, you will not be able to proceed.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.screenleap.com/signup?referer=hn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_applet_permission.jpg" alt="Grant the Screenleap Applet Permission" title="Grant the Screenleap Applet Permission" width="526" height="257" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-169" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_applet_permission.jpg 526w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_applet_permission-300x146.jpg 300w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_applet_permission-500x244.jpg 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Share Your Screen Sharing Handle<br />

Once you&#8217;ve started broadcasting your screen, you can direct friends and teammates to your personal screen sharing link.</p>

<p><strong>End Your Session<br />
</strong><br />
Always be sure to &#8220;Stop Sharing&#8221; when you&#8217;ve completed your screen sharing session.  If your meeting ends and you continue sharing, this could lead to accidentally sharing something you intended to be private.</p>

		</p><p>Sharing what’s on your computer screen with people across the web is a magical experience that truly enables you to communicate, collaborate, share, and connect.</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 557px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.screenleap.com"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="size-full wp-image-108" title="Introducing Screenleap" alt="Introducing Screenleap" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/screenleap_03d.jpg" width="547" height="335" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-caption-text">Introducing Screenleap</p></div>
<p>Prior to founding <a href="http://www.screenleap.com">Screenleap</a>, our team members made frequent use of screen sharing services such as WebEx and GoToMeeting. Unfortunately, these tools fall short of day-to-day needs by burdening the experience with unnecessary hurdles, ultimately causing people to avoid them altogether. Screen sharing shouldn’t be that way. It should be fast, simple, and free. This is the problem Screenleap seeks to solve.</p>
<p>After talking with hundreds of users about their experiences using existing screen sharing tools, we found a common list of complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its too cumbersome to start a meeting – most of the time its just not worth it</li>
<li>It takes me five to ten minutes to start a meeting with a new viewer because they have to download and install a new application</li>
<li>My viewers can’t view it if they’re on a smartphone or tablet device</li>
<li>My viewers refuse to install the application or I don&#8217;t want to burden them with a required install</li>
<li>Its too complicated – I can’t figure it out</li>
<li>The service is expensive, or I don’t want to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>We share these frustrations and resolved to launch a product that completely eliminates, or drastically mitigates, each of the above complaints. The result is found at Screenleap.com and is the product of countless hours of research, hacking, coding, and user input.</p>
<p>The Screenleap mission is to make screen sharing as simple, fast, free, and easy as possible.</p>
<p>So today we officially launch Screenleap to the public with the following alpha features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-click instant screen sharing for first time users</li>
<li>One-click instant screen sharing for visitors who have previously granted permission to our applet</li>
<li>No accounts required</li>
<li>No application install to view a screen</li>
<li>Works on any connected mobile or tablet device with a browser</li>
<li>The basic version is Free, and always will be</li>
</ul>
