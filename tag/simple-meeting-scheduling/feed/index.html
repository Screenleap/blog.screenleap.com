		</p><p>About a year ago, we launched our broadcasting feature, which made it possible for you to share your screen to a handle that you select (i.e., http://www.screenleap.com/<em>your_company</em>). Viewers can view your broadcast simply by going to your broadcast page. When you are not actively broadcasting, your broadcast page serves to welcome your visitors: previously, a visitor would see a generic message; with this update, you can now customize the message that is shown to those visitors.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>How It Works</b></p>
<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/signup">sign up for a free Screenleap account</a> in order to use the broadcast feature. After signing in to the Screenleap site, you will now see a <b>Customize your broadcast page</b> link. Clicking on this link will show you what visitors to your broadcast page will see when you are not broadcasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_default.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826" alt="Screen share broadcast page default message" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_default.png" width="618" height="336" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_default.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_default-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>You can customize the message shown to visitors by clicking the <b>Edit</b> button at the top of the page and then on the name or description to update the message.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_edit.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827" alt="Edit screen share broadcast page message" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_edit.png" width="620" height="454" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_edit.png 620w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/broadcast_message_edit-300x219.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>Click the <b>Update</b> button when you are done to save your changes. If you are a user on a Premium Account, you will also have the option of customizing the messages that are shown to visitors when you are in the middle of a restricted or locked broadcast (see next week&#8217;s blog entry for more details).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>Ideas For Use</b></p>
<p>You can use the broadcast page message to further engage your visitors:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Contact Information</b> &#8211; Put your contact info so that your visitors will know how to get in touch when you are not broadcasting.</li>
<li><b>Simple Meeting Scheduling</b> &#8211; After you schedule a presentation, update your broadcast page message with information about the presentation so that viewers who show up early will know that they are in the right place.</li>
<li><b>Supplementary Materials</b> &#8211; Include links to supplementary materials (such as white papers) that your viewers can review after seeing your presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>What’s Next</b></p>
<p>Next week, we will cover two additional broadcasting features that we just released: broadcast restriction (the ability to restrict a broadcasts to viewers with an access code that you specify) and broadcast locking (the ability to lock an active broadcast to prevent new viewers from joining).</p>
