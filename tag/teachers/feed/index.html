		</p><p>We are excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://www.screenleap.com/education">Screenleap for Education</a>, a new solution designed specifically for teachers. Screenleap for Education is the easiest way for teachers to share their screens with their students and record it for later viewing. As always with Screenleap, students can view from any web-enabled device without installing any software.</p>
<p>Teachers can use Screenleap for Education to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow students to follow along from any device,</li>
<li>allow-visually impaired students to easily see their screens,</li>
<li>give students the ability to review lessons before their exams,</li>
<li>track student engagement in real-time, and</li>
<li>save hundreds of hours each year by not having to reteach lessons to students who miss a class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setup Classes</strong></p>
<p>Getting set up with Screenleap for Education is easy: teachers can create classes and add students manually using our web interface or by importing the class and student information from a CSV file. Only students added to a class will be able to view the screen share for that class.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Setup Classes" width="618" height="308" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/setup_classes_618-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p><strong>Screen Share for a Class</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education makes it easy for teachers to share their screens with their students. They can start a screen share for a class with a single click. We support sharing from Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, iPhones/iPads, and Android devices (including SMART Boards).</p>
<p>Students will see the list of classes they have been added to when they sign in. They can view the screen share for a class and listen to the audio with a single click—there&#8217;s no need for teachers to share a new link or code with their students each time they share their screen.</p>
<p><strong>Share Recordings</strong></p>
<p>When teachers share their screen using Screenleap for Education, we can automatically record their screen shares (including audio) using our cloud recording feature and make it available to their students after the screen share ends. Because we perform the recording in the cloud, there is no need for teachers to upload any recording after they finish their screen shares: it automatically becomes available after the screen share ends. Making recordings of their classes available to their students will help teachers improve their students&#8217; learning by allowing students to review class lessons before their exams and when they miss a class.</p>
<p><strong>Track Student Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education also allows teachers to track student engagement in real-time. Once they start sharing their screen for a class, they can open up a separate page that allows them to see which of their students are engaged with their lesson.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png" alt="Screenleap for Education - Student Engagement Graph" width="618" height="517" srcset="https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618.png 618w, https://blog.screenleap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/student_engagement_graph_618-300x251.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>We track and show them when students are viewing their screen share so they can see when their students are watching their screen share and when they are viewing another site. This allows them to see when they are losing their students&#8217; interest or when they need to intervene with specific students who are not paying attention. Teachers can also review the student engagement graphs after their screen share ends from the recordings page.</p>
<p><strong>Sign Up for Free Pilot</strong></p>
<p>Screenleap for Education costs $99/year per teacher. We are currently offering Screenleap for Education for free for the fall semester. This will let you try out Screenleap risk-free at your school so you can see the benefits for yourself.</p>
