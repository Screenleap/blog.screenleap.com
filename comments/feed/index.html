Unfortunately, your Internet speed will make a differenc in the performance of the screen share. Your screen share will only be as fast as your Internet connection because we need to send the data in real time. The lag time of the screen share will be the time it takes for your screen data to be sent from your computer to our server and then onward to the viewer. The faster your computer and your Internet connection is, the faster your screen share will be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I  think, that this is an excellent service and just, what I am looking for.  But I have one question:

I  my screen uploaded to your server and then shared with all participants and does that mean,  that  my  transfer speed to the internet does not matter ?

Because  my speed is less than 0,5 Mps  and that causes problems, when I try to use Skype with several participants in a meeting.

What is also very good, is, that  participants don´t have to download any software onto their computer, because many employees are not allowed to do that.

regards

Martin]]></description>

You can switch presenters right now. During a screen share, a viewer can click the &quot;Become presenter&quot; button and you will be asked if you want to switch presenter. If you allow, the presenter will be switched to the viewer who requested. We don&#039;t support giving a viewer control of your mouse yet but it is something we are considering as a future enhancement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The ability to switch presenters or give mouse control to a viewer is critical to online meetings.  I would like to request a way to do this without the meeting attendees having a ScreenLeap account.  Can you tell me if this is in the queue for future additions to the program?  Or is it offered in the pro version?]]></description>
