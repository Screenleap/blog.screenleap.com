Computer audio conferencing allows you to speak with the people in your meetings using your computer&#8217;s microphone and speakers. You no longer need to call a separate dial-in number in order to speak to each other, which makes it even easier and faster to start your meetings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enabling Computer Audio Conferencing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio conferencing is available to users on our <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">paid subscription plans<\/a>. If you are a paid subscriber, you can enable computer audio conferencing by going to your <strong>Settings &amp; Preferences<\/strong> from the <strong>Account<\/strong> menu. Select <strong>Yes, use computer audio conferencing <\/strong>for the<strong> Audio Preferences<\/strong> setting and then save your change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using Computer Audio Conferencing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start a meeting with computer audio conferencing enabled, you will be able to speak to other people in your meeting using your computer&#8217;s microphone and speakers. Everyone will need to be on a computer with a microphone and speakers and using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) in order to user computer audio conferencing. Computer audio conferencing also works for mobile viewers using any browser on Android and the Safari browser on iOS devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The microphone and speakers default to the defaults for your computer. You can change the microphone and speakers used by moving your mouse over the <strong>Room<\/strong> panel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"491\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/computer_audio-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2142\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/computer_audio-1.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/computer_audio-1-300x230.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can mute your microphone during your meeting by clicking on the microphone icon. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limitations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer audio conferencing is currently only available when you use our our installation-free screen sharing option.
