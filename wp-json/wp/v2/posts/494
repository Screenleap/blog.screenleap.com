This means that your screen shares are protected from unauthorized access during transmission from your computer to your viewers. SSL is the same encryption technology that banks use to secure your data and is recommended for users who are sharing sensitive information.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to SSL security, we have also set up faster and more powerful servers that are reserved exclusively for Pro Account users. Because of the popularity of our free screen sharing service, the performance of individual screen shares can sometimes slow during periods of high demand (such as during the mid-morning period). With dedicated servers, Pro Account users can be sure of having faster and more reliable screen shares for those important sales demos and product pitches. It is recommended that all business users take advantage of Pro Accounts to ensure the best performance for their screen shares.<\/p>\n<p>You can get started now by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/signup?accountType=PRO\">signing up for a Pro Account<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Holidays Screenleapers!
