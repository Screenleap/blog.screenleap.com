I started out as a freelancer and currently work at Screenleap, which has a mostly distributed team.<\/p>\n<p>Before I jumped into remote work, I had no idea what it would be like. I just dove in and started doing it full time. Unfortunately, reality hit me in less than a month: the transition from working in an office to working remotely wasn\u2019t as smooth as I expected. Some aspects of remote working that I was really excited about (like not having to commute to the office and being able to choose when I worked) made me feel good, but the unexpected negatives were wearing on me.<\/p>\n<p>I found that I was less productive working remotely than when I was in the office. This is despite the fact that I was saving time from not having to commute. I\u2019d often procrastinate and get distracted. When a deadline approached, I would rush to get the work done. Not only did the quantity of work that I produced decrease, but the quality suffered as well.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn\u2019t going in the right direction, and I was frustrated. I took a break from my work and tried to figure out if there were things that I could be doing to be more productive working remotely. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went through how successful remote workers from companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/open.bufferapp.com\/remote-working-means-tools-use\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buffer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/ma.tt\/2013\/08\/automattics-remote-work-culture\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automattic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/devslovebacon.com\/conferences\/bacon-2014\/talks\/remote-by-default-how-github-makes-working-remotely-not-suck\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/37signals.com\/remote\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basecamp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work. I noticed common practices that successful remote workers shared<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I started working them into my own practice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are six tips about remote working that I learned and wished that I had known when I was getting started. Maybe you can relate to some of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Test the waters and build up the necessary skills before committing full time<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re working remotely, you\u2019re your own boss. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you\u2019ll still have someone that you report to, you are ultimately responsible for getting the work done and in a timely manner. There is no one around to make sure that you are working or to check that you are on trac<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">k.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need someone to watch over you or to push you to get your work done, you should probably test the waters with a few projects before committing to it full time. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with a few projects will also allow you time to learn how to pick up the necessary skills to work effectively remotely and to adapt to your new work environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As our CEO Tuyen aptly puts it:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>&#8220;Working remotely is a skill that, like every other skill, takes practice and time to learn to do effectively.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t agree more.<\/p>\n<p><b>Create a dedicated workspace<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to work from everywhere around the house. This went well for first couple of weeks. But soon I noticed its disadvantages:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often write notes and other important things either in my notebook, on stickies, and on whatever I find lying around the house. As a result, I frequently lost track of important notes as they were distributed all over the place. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had hard time handling the distractions that came from other people in the house. It wasn\u2019t their fault though. I didn\u2019t specifically set boundaries and let them know when I was working and when I wasn\u2019t.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that it is really important to create a dedicated space to be used exclusively for your work. The aim is to <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keep your work and personal stuff separate<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">let others (spouse, kids, parents, pets\u2026) know that you\u2019re working so that you aren\u2019t disturbed. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b>Stick to a schedule<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bellebcooper\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Belle Beth Cooper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a longtime remote worker, explains neatly about <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toptal.com\/remote\/how-to-make-remote-working-work-for-you\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creating schedules for remote work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She writes:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What time do you work best?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Depending on your natural body clock, you may work well at 2am, 6pm, or 9am. You might have a natural dip in energy in the early afternoon (many of us do), or you might find your energy tanks after dinner (mine does).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s body clock is different, but most of us fall into one of three categories, known as chronotypes:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morning larks: Also known as early birds, these people prefer to get up early and go to bed early. New Scientist reports about 10% of people fit into this category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Night owls: At the other extreme, these people like to sleep in and go to bed late, usually after midnight. Around 20% of us are night owls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In-between: The rest of us (the vast majority) fit somewhere in-between these two ends of the spectrum.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve found that when I work in 2 hours slots (i.e. 11am-1pm, 2pm-4pm, 6pm-8pm, and 9pm-11pm), I can manage my energy better and I\u2019m more productive. I do my creative work during the slots when I have the most energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiment and choose the time of the day when you tend to have the most energy (according to your body clock) to maximise your productivity. This might not be feasible depending upon the type of remote work that you are doing, but it has a lot of advantages if your work allows for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Take regular breaks<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaks are really <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/open.bufferapp.com\/science-taking-breaks-at-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">important<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By working continuously without any breaks, you\u2019ll start to lose focus and become unproductive. This is especially true when you\u2019re working alone\u2014scheduling breaks in advance can help you a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide on lunch time. Take breaks for coffee or for any other small activity like walking the dog. It\u2019s important to step out of the work once in a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design your schedule in such a way that you can work when you\u2019re most energetic and take breaks during your low energy periods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Learn to communicate effectively using written communication<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since most communication in a remote team happens via text (emails, chat, etc.), it is important to learn how to communicate effectively using written communication. There\u2019s a balance between saying too much and not saying enough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to write things that weren\u2019t necessary because I thought that the extra info might help my clients or coworkers to understand things better. I also used to write things in an ambiguously clever way in failed attempts to make conversations more interesting. But when I started getting replies like \u201cFrom what I understand, I think you\u2019re trying to say \u2026.\u201d and \u201cOh, you meant to say\u2026 Is that so?\u201d more often, I understood that it wasn\u2019t a good practice. I started applying what I learned about writing content (which by the way, I\u2019m still learning) to my communication with my team:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be clear: Clarity is essential and key to effective communication. Leave no room for ambiguity in your writing. Reiterate what others ask you to do to you to make sure that you understand correctly. Ask clearly what you need from others.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use numbered lists when you are discussing more than one thing at a time. It will be less cluttered, easier to understand, and easier for the other person to reference when responding.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, here is a small conversation we recently had on Slack:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1710\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenleap_Slack.jpg\" alt=\"Written Communication at Screenleap\" width=\"704\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenleap_Slack.jpg 801w, https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenleap_Slack-300x164.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Works well, right?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it\u2019s not easy to explain something using text. It can be helpful to elaborate using screenshots. Or better yet, jump on a quick screen share when you need to explain something. We use Screenleap a lot for this.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Find social outlets to prevent loneliness<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation is inevitable part of working remotely. Feeling isolated is not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even people who aren\u2019t social need to be around others every so often. To combat loneliness, you can:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join a coworking space.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work from coffee shops.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat with your coworkers more often. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be about work. Most of the remote companies have rooms in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipchat.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HipChat<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for water cooler\/general conversations. Use them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Over to you<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What advice do you wish you had heard when you first started working remotely?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d love to hear your experience and what you\u2019ve found helpful along the way.
