Over the last year, we have been hard at work rebuilding Screenleap from the ground up to make it faster, more scalable, and more reliable. We are excited to announce today that we have released the new platform. Your Screenleap screen shares will automatically take advantage of the improvements that it provides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most important factors affecting the success of your screen shares is how quickly your viewers can see what is on your screen. You want your viewers to be able to a) see your screen instantly and without any hassle and b) see the changes to your screen update quickly on their screens. Screenleap has always enabled the former by making viewing an installation-free experience.<\/p>\n<p>Our new screen-sharing platform improves upon the latter by further reducing the time it takes for changes on your screen to appear on your viewers\u2019 screens. Using our new streaming technology, we allow you to get the contents of your screen to your viewers&#8217; screen faster than ever. The frustrating process of asking your viewers if they see what is on your screen is now a thing of the past with Screenleap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More Viewers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The latest version of our platform also increases the maximum number of viewers that you can have on a single screen share from 150 to over 10,000. We will be offering a new plan in the future that will allow you to take advantage of the higher viewer limit. If you would like to gain early access to higher limit, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@screenleap.com\">support@screenleap.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More Reliable And Consistent Screen Shares<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The latest release of the Screenleap platform also makes your screen shares perform more reliably and consistently. While it\u2019s difficult to make real-time communication completely reliable, our new platform gets us closer by replacing our usage of technologies that are problematic for some of our users (such as WebSockets) with technologies that are more robust and reliable without sacrificing performance.<\/p>\n<p>We have also re-engineered our viewer technology so that viewers on slower networks no longer negatively affect the update speed of viewers on faster networks. What this means for you is that you can expect your viewers to experience fewer issues when connecting to your screen shares and experience more consistent screen shares once they connect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give It A Try<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All current Screenleap users have been automatically updated with these improvements. If you\u2019ve never used Screenleap before, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\">http:\/\/www.screenleap.com<\/a> and click on the \u201cShare your screen now\u201d button to get started.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to give one of our paid plans a try, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@screenleap.com\">support@screenleap.com<\/a> to get setup with a free trial.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the improvements to Screenleap that will make your screen shares more hassle-free and successful. We will be announcing several new features in the coming weeks, so please stay tuned for more updates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a while since our last blog post, but we have some exciting news to share with you today.
