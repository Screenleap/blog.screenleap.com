An anonymous screen share is a screen share that you start by clicking the &#8220;Share your screen now!&#8221; button on our site. They are designed to make it easy for you to try out Screenleap and to start a screen share quickly when you are in a hurry.\u00a0To bring anonymous screen shares in line with their intended usage, we will be limiting them to twenty minutes per day and two viewers starting September 7th.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 48px;\">\n<p><strong>Benefits of Creating An Account<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We want to encourage you to create an account since it allows us to provide you with the best user experience.\u00a0Signed-in users will continue to be able to share for two hours a day with an unlimited number of viewers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"limitations\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/limitations1.png\" width=\"627\" height=\"329\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to longer screen shares and high viewer limits, signed-in users will also get access to these additional features:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personal URL<\/strong>: When you create a Screenleap account, you choose a handle which your viewers can use to view your screen (e.g. http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/<em>YourName<\/em>).
