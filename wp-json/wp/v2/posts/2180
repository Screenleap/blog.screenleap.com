Your meetings are less likely to end unexpectedly as a result.<\/li><li>You do not need to worry about keeping your app up-to-date. As a result, your meetings are less likely to be delayed by an app update.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Installation-free sharing is now available on all desktop computers with a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari). The add-on, which provides support for rectangle mode and control sharing, is currently available for Mac and Windows computers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy the added convenience and benefits provided by installation-free sharing with add-on support\u2014especially when you are collaborating with external users, such as your prospects and business partners.
