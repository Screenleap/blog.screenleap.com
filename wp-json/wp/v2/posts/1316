Audio conferencing is available for free on all Screenleap accounts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Screenshots<\/strong><br \/>\nIn February, we launched\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/screenshots\/overview\">Screenshots<\/a>, a browser extension that allows you to easily take screenshots of web pages, mark them up, and share them with others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Browser Sharing<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The browser extension we launched in February also includes support for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/browser-share\">browser\u00a0<\/a><\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/browser-share\">sharing<\/a>. Browser sharing<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0is like screen sharing except only the contents of your browser are shared. It&#8217;s especially convenient since it doesn&#8217;t require you to have Java installed, and it works on Chromebook computers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Broadcast Page Customization<\/strong><br \/>\nIn July, we added the ability to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/2013\/07\/08\/customize-your-broadcast-page-message\/\">customize your broadcast page message<\/a>. When you create a Screenleap account, you select a personal handle. Now you can customize the message viewers see when they visit your handle page (e.g., http:\/\/screenleap.com\/<em>your_handle<\/em>)\u00a0when you are not broadcasting your screen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Broadcast Restriction and Locking<\/strong><br \/>\nBy default, broadcasts are public and viewable by anyone who visits your handle page. If you would like to share your screen to your handle page but want to restrict who can view your broadcast, you can do so as of the launch of <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/2013\/07\/15\/secure-your-broadcasts-with-broadcast-restriction-and-broadcast-locking\/\">broadcast restriction and locking<\/a>\u00a0in late July.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Screenleap for Mac &amp; Screenleap for Windows<\/strong><br \/>\nHaving made viewing installation-free and hassle-free, we next turned our attention to towards simplifying the screen share process. We launched our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/desktop-screen-share#mac\">Screenleap for Mac<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/desktop-screen-share#win\">Screenleap for Windows<\/a> apps in August, which allow you to share your entire screen without having to first install Java on your computer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Screenleap API, Version 2<\/strong><br \/>\nWe released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/api\/update\">version 2 of the Screenleap API<\/a> in September. The Screenleap API makes it easy to programatically add screen sharing to your web app. Version 2 includes support for additional sharing options, customization options, and integration options. You now have the option of allowing your presenters to share their screen using the Mac and Windows apps in addition to the applet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Coming in 2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Branded Company Accoount<\/strong><br \/>\nWe will be launching our Branded Company Accounts next week. Branded Company Accounts will allow you to increase your viewers&#8217; exposure to your brand by providing them with a branded screen sharing experience for those important sales, support, and training calls. Branded Company Accounts will also include support for integrating the screen share viewer into your website, so your users don&#8217;t have to leave your website to view your screen shares.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer Support Solution<\/strong><br \/>\nOur upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/customer-support-software\">customer support solution<\/a> will allow you to easily see your customers&#8217; screens so you can provide them with faster and more effective support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Faster Screen Shares<\/strong><br \/>\nWe will be taking advantage of a new web technology called WebRTC that allows us to double the performance of screen shares for browsers that support the new technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wishing You a Happy 2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We would like to thank you again for making 2013 a great one.\u00a0\u00a0We really appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that you have provided us over the last year: Screenleap is the tool it is today because of you.
