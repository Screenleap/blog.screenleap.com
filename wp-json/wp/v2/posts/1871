The viewer who wants to become the new presenter\u00a0needs to initiate a presenter swap by clicking the &#8220;Become presenter&#8221; button at the top-right part of the viewer page.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1883\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_button.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_button.png 618w, https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_button-300x211.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You will be asked if you want\u00a0to grant the viewer permission to be the new presenter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1884\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_grant_permission.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_grant_permission.png 618w, https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/presenter_swap_grant_permission-300x127.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you\u00a0say yes, the viewer will start sharing his\/her screen and you will be redirected to the viewer page so that you will be able to see his\/her screen. Viewers who have not previously shared using Screenleap will be first prompted to download and install the presenter app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Presenter swap cannot be initiated by the presenter because we do not require viewers to sign in before being able to see your screen. As a result, it is not possible for the presenter to select which viewer he\/she wants to be the new presenter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tell\u00a0Us About Your Experience<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We hope you find the presenter swap feature useful.
