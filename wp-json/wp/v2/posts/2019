You do not need to call a conference number like you do with audio conferencing: you simply need to speak into your computer&#8217;s microphone. Your viewers will not need to install any software in order to hear your broadcasted audio: all they need is a web browser.<\/p>\n<p>Broadcast audio will be especially helpful for those of you giving webinars or teaching classes as your attendees will not need to dial into a conference line in order to hear you. Although broadcast audio is one-way, you will still be able to interact with your viewers using our integrated chat functionality.<\/p>\n<p>You can broadcast your audio from all supported sharing devices, including Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, iOS, and Android.\u00a0To enable broadcast audio, go to your <strong>Settings &amp; Preferences<\/strong> and select the broadcast audio option in the <strong>Audio Preferences<\/strong> section.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Upcoming Changes To Free Plans<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We will be making some changes to our free plans starting in January: the regular Free Account will be limited to 40 minutes of free sharing per day. The broadcast feature will also no longer be available on the free plan. You will be able to continue sharing using a unique screen share code that is generated for each of your screen shares.<\/p>\n<p>We will also be discontinuing the Education Free Accounts, which previously offered two hours per day of free sharing for people with education email addresses. We now offer a discounted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/education\">education-specific solution<\/a> for schools that priced at $99\/year per teacher with the purchase of 10 or more seats. Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/contact-sales\">contact sales<\/a> to learn more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are excited to announce that broadcast audio is now available on all paid plans.
