Please tell us a little about yourself.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m the Head of Marketing for <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.groovehq.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groove<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where we work on building the best customer service tools for small businesses. Our whole team is remote: I work from my home office in Baltimore, Maryland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also write about home office productivity, work\/life balance, and happiness on my blog <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.homeofficehero.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Office Hero<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How long have you been working remotely? Why did you choose to work remotely?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For around five years now. In 2010 I was living in San Francisco, doing marketing for a startup, and taking the bus downtown every day to our office on the 19<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> floor of a soulless corporate skyscraper. I loved the work, but hated the commute. When the company got acquired and I decided to start my own business, working from home was an easy choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How\u00a0does your typical day look like?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wake up at around 6am and make coffee while my wife gets ready to leave (she just went back to school to study medicine). She heads out at around 7, and that\u2019s when I tackle my biggest task of the day\u2014usually that\u2019s a blog post or other big content piece. It\u2019s still early enough that I don\u2019t get interrupted by emails or Slack notifications. I\u2019ll typically work through lunch, eating at my desk. Because I start early, I typically run out of creative steam around mid-afternoon, so I take a gym break then before coming back and dealing with more mindless administrative stuff like responding to emails and getting things in order for the next day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I try not to work past 6pm or so, but I\u2019m far from perfect. We have dinner around then, and then I\u2019ll either read or mindlessly goof off on the Internet, depending on how much impulse control I have that day. I like to take a walk before bed, an awesome head-clearing habit I started doing after reading <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/joel.is\/tag\/evening-walk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel Gascoigne\u2019s post about it<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What apps do you use? What apps can&#8217;t you live without? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For work, I spend the overwhelming majority of my time in just four apps: Google Docs for writing and editing, <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\">Slack<\/a> for chatting with the Groove team, <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\">Trello<\/a> for managing projects and to-do\u2019s, and <a href=\"http:\/\/mailplaneapp.com\/\">Mailplane<\/a> for easy switching between my various Gmail accounts. For non-work stuff, I love <a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/\">Headspace<\/a> for guided meditation and <a href=\"http:\/\/simplenote.com\/\">Simplenote<\/a> for not having to rely on my less-than-stellar memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How does Groove\u2019s team overcome the collaboration challenge (like explaining complex concepts or issues such as the steps for reproducing a bug) while working remotely?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more and more teams have started to work remotely and more and more tools have been developed for them, that challenge has really diminished. There\u2019s very little that you can\u2019t explain or convey to a remote coworker. Screen-sharing apps (like <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screenleap<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) make that really easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the biggest benefit of working remotely? What\u2019s the biggest challenge?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The biggest benefit for me is flexibility. I get to work the hours that I\u2019m most productive, I don\u2019t have to waste time commuting and I can work from anywhere I\u2019d like to.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest benefit for our team is recruiting. We can hire the best talent, regardless of where they are<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, the biggest challenge remote work presents is no longer collaboration or communication, but culture. Being in one place together helps culture develop naturally through the connections and conversations you have day in and day out. You have to work hard to recreate that dynamic online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>So how does Groove develop a culture when everyone is remote? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing that we do to develop culture is try to replace the social element of a physical office with a \u201cvirtual water cooler.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For us, that virtual water cooler is a room in Slack that\u2019s reserved for non-work-related conversations. There\u2019s a lot of back-and-forth banter, folks post photos of their pets, the music they\u2019re listening to, random links from the Internet\u2014things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every week, we also have a team poker tournament on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replaypoker.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ReplayPoker.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We take an hour off and do a group call on Skype while we play poker. It\u2019s an awesome way to be social and get to know each other while having fun. And of course, there are prizes for winners \ud83d\ude42<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>That\u2019s interesting. How do you think it will scale as the company gets bigger?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s challenging to keep culture intact as you grow, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to spend time investing in building a strong cultural foundation now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the culture becomes deeply ingrained across a small team, it\u2019s easier for each member of that small early team to help keep the culture alive as the company expands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We also take cultural really seriously when we hire. And that must continue, whether you\u2019re hiring employee number 10, 100 or 1,000.<\/p>\n<p><b>That\u2019s great, Len. Coming back to your working style, how do you minimize distractions while working from home? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing for me is to take my own willpower (or lack of it) completely out of the equation. I use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/stayfocusd\/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">StayFocusd<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Chrome extension that blocks any site I tell it to (e.g., Facebook, etc\u2026) during the hours I want to be working. It\u2019s amazing how much more productive this tool makes me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Any advice you would give to others who are considering working remotely?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that you\u2019re self-aware enough to know your shortcomings, and put systems in place to overcome them. If you know that you\u2019re easily distracted, remove the distractions. If you know that you have trouble separating work and life and tend to work long hours if left unchecked, set \u201coff-limits\u201d times for your office and tell whoever you live with to keep you accountable for sticking to them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and put on some pants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>That\u2019s a great suggestion :D. We would love to see your remote work setup. Could you share it with us?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, here\u2019s my desk, along with my officemate Zoe:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1768\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/image01-e1443008171418.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Work Tips - Interview with Len Markidan from Groove\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Awesome :). If there were one thing you could change about current remote work scenario, what would you change?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve been able to pretty much build my work life as I want it to be, so there isn\u2019t anything I can think of that I\u2019d change. With that said, an espresso machine mounted behind my desk would be nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>And the last question: What app for remote work you\u2019d love to have but doesn\u2019t exist?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d pay any amount of money for an app that blasted Nickelback (at an uncomfortably high volume) at Comcast HQ every time the Internet at my house goes down. I suspect connectivity would start looking a bit better around here fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was awesome talking to you, Len. Thank you so much for all the remote work tips\u00a0and your time.
