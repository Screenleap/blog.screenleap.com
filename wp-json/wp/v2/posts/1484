All you need is the browser extension.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>All-In-One Extension<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You no longer need to install a separate browser extension to integrate Screenleap with Gmail. It has now been added to the Screenleap browser extension. We decided to merge the two extensions together to reduce the confusion caused by having multiple browsers extensions and to make it easier to enhance\u00a0the extension in the future. The merged Screenleap extension will be the only extension that we support going forward. Please <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenleap.com\/faq#gmail-extension-uninstall\">uninstall the Screenleap for Gmail extension<\/a> if it&#8217;s installed and install the merged Screenleap extension.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Java No Longer Required<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Screenleap for Gmail<\/strong> extension required that Java be installed in order to share your screen. This requirement created a hassle if you did not have Java installed as you would have to download Java, install it, and restart your browser before you were able to start sharing\u00a0your screen. With the new Gmail integration, all you need is the browser extension.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How To Use<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/screenleap\/hpcipbhehomfgjbgnajdhiahhdeeffbg\">Install the Screenleap extension<\/a> and then refresh the Gmail tab. Once installed, two new icons will appear in the bottom of your\u00a0Gmail compose window. To start a new share from Gmail, simply click on either the screen or browser icon. The screen icon is used to initiate sharing of your entire screen. The browser icon is used to initiate sharing of just your browser window.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/screenleap_gmail_integration.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1488\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/screenleap_gmail_integration.png\" alt=\"screenleap_gmail_integration\" width=\"618\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/screenleap_gmail_integration.png 618w, https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/screenleap_gmail_integration-300x294.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><\/a>Once your screen is shared, the share link will automatically be inserted into your email message.
