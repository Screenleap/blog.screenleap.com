Your viewers will continue to be able to view from any device without installing any software.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coming Soon<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are putting the finishing touches on our WebRTC-based implementation of our browser share extension. Users on Chrome or Firefox will soon be able to experience a significant improvement in performance by taking advantage of WebRTC&#8217;s browser-to-browser connections. Unlike other WebRTC-based screen sharing solutions, Screenleap&#8217;s solution will also work on browsers that don&#8217;t support WebRTC (albeit with slightly slower performance).<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for your continued support!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As you head back to work or school, we want to share with you some recent changes that will make your screen sharing experience even better: Improved audio conferencing call quality New default presenter app HD Audio Conferencing Our audio conferencing feature has gotten even better: It now features improved audio quality for crystal-clear conference [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[110,199],"class_list":["post-1455","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-screenleap","tag-coming-soon","tag-screenleap"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1455","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1455"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1455\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1463,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1455\/revisions\/1463"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1455"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1455"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.screenleap.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1455"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
